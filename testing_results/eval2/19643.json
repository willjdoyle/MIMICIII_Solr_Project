The\npatient's head went through the windshield.  There was\npositive loss of consciousness.  The patient had an initial\n[**Location (un) 2611**] coma scale of 14 at the scene.  The patient also\nstated that he had roughly ten drinks the night of the\naccident.  The patient was initially hemodynamically stable,\nand was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] Trauma Center.  During the resuscitation the patient\nhad an endotracheal tube placed, a left chest tube placed, a\ncentral line and Foley catheter.  The patient was\nresuscitated and during the resuscitation it was noted that\nthe patient had a mediastinal hematoma, most likely secondary\nto an aortic arch disruption.  The patient also had a liver\nlaceration and a splenic laceration.  The patient was brought\nto the Operating Room emergently.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  None.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive ethyl alcohol, no smoking and no\nrecreational drugs.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 96.8,\nblood pressure 106/82, heart rate 106, respiratory rate 22,\noxygen saturations 95% on 5 liters.  Blood gas 7.4, 32, 97,\n21 and -3.  White cell count 10.3, hematocrit 31, platelets\n196.  Coagulation screen 14.7, 44 and 1.4.  The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale on arrival was 14 with -1 for confusion.\nHead, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils are equal and\nreactive 3 to 2 on the right and 5 to 3 on the left.\nExtraocular muscles intact.  Tympanic membranes were clear.\nThere was positive blood in oropharynx.  Cardiovascular,\nregular rate and rhythm, no rubs.  Respiratory:  Clear to\nauscultation bilaterally.  Chest: No crepitus.  Abdomen:\nSoft, nontender, positive bowel sounds, distended.  Pelvis\nwas stable, flank, no deformities or tenderness bilaterally.\nBack:  No deformities.  Cervical spine and thoracic,\nlumbosacral spines, no deformities, stepoffs or tenderness.\nRectal, guaiac negative.  Good rectal tone.  Right and left\nupper extremity, no deformities.  Right lower extremity and\nleft lower extremity no deformities.  Pulses, palpable\nradial, femoral, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial, no\npalpable abdominal masses.\n\nImaging - Chest x-ray widened mediastinum.  Pelvis within\nnormal limits.  Cervical spine, not imaged.  Back normal.\nHead computerized tomography scan within normal limits.\nComputerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed a splenic\nGrade 2 and liver laceration.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought emergently from the\nEmergency Department to the Operating Room where he had an\nexploratory laparotomy.  During the exploratory laparotomy a\nliver laceration was noted.  It was sutured and coagulated\nusing the Argon beam.  The spleen appeared to be intact with\nno signs of hemorrhage.  The abdomen was packed off in four\nquadrants.  During the same time Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a\nmedian sternotomy to evaluate the aortic injury.  At that\ntime it was decided that the aortic arch would not be\nrepaired due to the patient's coagulopathy, hypothermia and\noverall instability.  A cardiac window was performed and\nrelieved serosanguinous/blood.  The drain was placed in the\npericardium.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive\nCare Unit in guarded condition.  During the patient's\nIntensive Care Unit stay he required a significant amount of\nresuscitation including intravenous fluids and blood\nproducts.  During that time the patient's respiratory status\ndeteriorated.  The patient was placed on pressure controlled\nventilation and required significant amount of support.  At\nthe same time the patient continued to be unstable, requiring\npressors and fluid.\n\nFamily meeting was held on [**1-15**] to discuss the\npatient's status.  During that meeting the family decided\nthat the patient will be made Do-Not-Resuscitate,\nDo-Not-Intubate and possibly Care-Measures-Only depending on\nthe status throughout the day.  Shortly after the meeting,\nthe family changed their decision and decided to make the\npatient Care-Measures-Only.  After discussions with Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], the family, the Intensive Care Unit staff and\nCardiothoracic, it was decided the patient would be made\nCare-Measures-Only.  Fluid and pressors were withdrawn.  The\npatient was started on a Morphine drip.  Shortly thereafter\nthe patient became bradycardiac and expired.  The patient's\ntime of death was 3:55 PM.  The family was notified of the\ndeath.\n\nDISCHARGE/DEATH DIAGNOSIS:\n1.  Status post motor vehicle crash with aortic arch\ndisruption.\n2.  Splenic laceration.\n3.  Liver laceration.\n4.  Acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n5.  Coagulopathy.\n\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Ethyl alcohol abuse.\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 11889**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 959**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2115-1-15**]  18:01\nT:  [**2115-1-15**]  17:29\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 53210**]\n",
