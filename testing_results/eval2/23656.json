There was\nsome difficulty intubating the patient initially, with an\nattempt at an open tracheostomy that was unsuccessful.\nEventually the patient was intubated endotracheally and\nunderwent\na head CT and a torso CT scan on the outside as well.\n\nHis head CT showed multiple petechial hemorrhages and severe\ndiffuse brain injury in both hemispheres. He had a large\nright frontal contusion with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.\nHe was noted to have swollen ventricles, severe facial\nfractures, and right frontal bone and frontal sinus\nfractures. Initially his torso CT was read as negative, and\nhe was immediately transferred by [**Location (un) 7622**] to our\ninstitution.\n\nPast Medical History:\nParaplegic s/p MVC\nh/o alcoholism\nh/o cocaine abuse\n\nSocial History:\nh/o legal problems\nh/o alcoholism\nh/o cocaine abuse\n\nFamily History:\nN/A\n\nPhysical Exam:\nabdominal injuries (xlap with general) frontal bone fracture,\nintervent hemorage x4, intraparychimal bleed, pneumocephalus, R\nlat orbital wall fx, ICP to 90's, free air in abdomen\n\nmultiple petechial hemorrhages and severe\ndiffuse brain injury in both hemispheres.

Course:\nThis patient was transferred from an outside hospital by\n[**Location (un) 7622**] to [**Hospital1 69**].  Upon\narrival, he was noted to be tachycardic,\nwith a pressure in the low hundreds.  The torso CT scan was\nreviewed by our radiologists, and there was a question of\nfree air seen, previously missed.  Due to his hemodynamic\ninstability, it was decided to take him immediately to the\noperating room for an exploratory laparotomy.  On [**2150-4-26**], this patient\nwas taken to the operating room of the [**Hospital1 827**].  The patient underwent an Exploratory\nlaparotomy, Proximal jejunum serosal tear repair, Local\nexploration of  neck wound, with suture ligation of several\nbleeders.  This was performed by the trauma team and the\nneurosurgical team placed an ICP bolt monitor during the neck\nexploration. The patient was then transferred back to the\nintensive care unit following his operation.\n\nThe remainder of his course was very difficult and the patient\nhad been previously been placed on full code by his family.  The\nplan was to keep his ICP down, continue ventilation, b/l chest\ntubes remained in place.  ENT and opthamology were also\nconsulted. Due to the patient's complicated course and poor\nprognosis the patient's wife decided to make the patient\nDNR/DNI.  The organ bank was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the family, including\nthe wife and father remained present for support.  A morphine\ndrip was started for patient comfort. The patient expired\nshortly after confirmed with a brain death exam.  The patient\nexpired on [**2150-4-27**] in the intensive care unit.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nN/A\n\nDischarge Medications:\nN/A\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nstatus post motor vehicle accident\n\nDischarge Condition:\nPatient expired on [**2150-4-27**].\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nN/A\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nN/A\n\n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 520**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 3226**]\n\nCompleted by:[**2150-6-4**]",
