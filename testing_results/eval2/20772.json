He was hemodynamically stable\non transfer.  He was purported to have a crush injury parked\ncar.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, lower\nextremity edema, BPH, and arthritis.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS AT HOME:\n1. Nadolol 80 mg by mouth every day.\n2. Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth every day.\n3. Lasix 20 mg by mouth every day.\n\n\nINITIAL PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vital signs:  Temperature was 99.8\ndegrees, heart rate 56-65, blood pressure 240/110, and O2\nsaturation of 100%.  Exam, the patient opened eyes to pain.\nNo verbal response with right extremity flexion to pain with\na GCS of 6.  HEENT:  He was normocephalic and atraumatic.\nPupils were equal, round, and reactive  to light.  TMs clear.\nMidface stable.  Trachea midline.  Lungs:  Clear to\nauscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.\nAbdomen:  Soft.  Extremities:  With ankle edema and intact\nperipheral pulses.  Back:  No deformities.  Rectal:  Normal\ntone, guaiac negative.  Neuro:  No movement on the left side.\n\nINITIAL LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 9.3,\nhematocrit 43.7, platelets 302, PT 12.5, PTT 22.8, INR 1.0,\nfibrinogen 352, lactate 1.5, amylase 75, sodium 140,\npotassium 3.9, chloride 102, bicarb 29, BUN 15, creatinine\n0.6, and glucose 140.  UA was negative.  Urine tox negative.\nSerum tox negative.  ABG with re-intubation was 7.35 pH,\nbicarb 33, PO2 166, base excess of plus 4.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  Chest x-ray, elevated diaphragms with\nperihilar haziness and question wide mediastinum.  Pelvis, no\nfracture.  CT of head, right thalamic intraparenchymal bleed\nwith subarachnoid hemorrhage into the lateral ventricles.  CT\nof C-spine, deformity of C5 consistent with old injury.  CT\nof the chest, small basilar consolidation versus atelectasis.\nCT of the abdomen, no solid organ injury.\n\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated in\nthe Trauma Bay.  As stated above, he was unresponsive with a\nGCS of 6 and was intubated in the Trauma Bay for airway\nprotection.  He was started on propofol drip and given\nhydralazine, which resulted in some trend towards\nnormalization of his blood pressure.  He was taken to the CT\nscanner where the above mentioned findings were seen.  Given\nthis, an emergent neurosurgical consultation was obtained\nwith recommendations for admission to the intensive care unit\nwith blood pressure control.  He was loaded with Dilantin in\nthe trauma bay as well.  Over the course of the night, he did\nbecome bradycardic to the 30s with a drop in his blood\npressure, which responded to IV atropine.  He had a central\nline placed with the CVP of around 11, 12, and he was given\nIV fluid for resuscitation.  He had a repeat head CT the\nfollowing day, which showed no significant change in the\namount of bleeding due to the fact that this was thought to\nbe a pre-existing hypertensive intrathalamic bleed, which\nsubsequently caused his motor vehicle accident.  A CTA was\nordered at the request of Neurosurgery.  However, due to\ndifficulty in timing his bolus, this was unable to be done,\nand he had an MRI/MRA of his neck and circle of [**Location (un) 431**].  He\nadditionally had an MRI of his C-spine as well.  These showed\nno aneurysms or AVMs and a stenosis at the origin of his\nright internal carotid artery.  His MRI of the cervical spine\nwas without prevertebral soft tissue swelling or other\nindicators of cervical trauma, so his C-spine was clear on\nthat basis.  He continued to have a minimal response.  He did\nstart moving his left side, however, he would only localize\nthe pain to his upper extremities.  He subsequently had 2\nadditional head CTs, which showed no interval change.  Over\nthe course of the weekend, the patient's exam did not\nsignificantly change.  He was started on tube feeds and\nadvanced to goal.  He was given Lasix for diuresis and his\nvent was weaned down to pressure support.  Family meeting was\nconvened on [**5-20**], and the decision was made that because the\npatient's prognosis was extremely poor and it was unlikely\nthat he would ever return to even close degree of premorbid\nfunctioning that they would withdraw care and make him\ncomfort measures only.  Of note, in the days before this, he\ndid begin to spike temperatures.  He was pan cultured with no\nsignificant growth.  He had also been started on Cipro for a\nmucosal thickening of his maxillary sinus.  He also not only\ndid not improve, but had some diminished movement of his left\nside.  After discussion with the family, consensus was made\nand he was made comfort measures only.  He subsequently\nexpired in the ensuing hours.  The case was referred to the\nmedical examiner, who did not accept the case, and an autopsy\nwas declined by the family.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Intracranial hemorrhage secondary to\nhypertensive stroke in the right thalamus with\nintraventricular bleed.\n\n\n\n                        [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**MD Number(1) 17554**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13030**]\nMEDQUIST36\nD:  [**2137-5-20**] 19:48:34\nT:  [**2137-5-21**] 12:56:06\nJob#:  [**Job Number 36623**]\n",
