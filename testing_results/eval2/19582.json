The patient was a driver of a vehicle that collided\nhead-on into a tractor trailer.  The patient was\nunrestrained, and there was airbag deployment.  Patient was\nfound unresponsive at the scene.  Patient was intubated\nwithout difficulty at the scene.  Patient had flaccid\nextremities during the initial assessment.  The patient was\ntransferred to an outside hospital, stabilized, and then\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for\nfurther treatment.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass\ngraft.\n2. Hypertension.\n3. Hypercholesterolemia.\n4. Benign prostate hyperplasia.\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n1. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.\n2. Terazosin 5 mg p.o. q.d.\n3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.\n4. Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.\n5. Finasteride 5 mg p.o. q.d.\n\nALLERGIES:  Unknown.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.6, pulse\n86, blood pressure 145/74, respiratory rate 20, and O2\nsaturation is 100%, intubated.  General:  Patient is sedated,\nunresponsive to voice.  Eyes open spontaneously.  Pupils are\nequal and reactive, but sluggish 3 to 2 bilaterally.\nOropharynx is clear.  Trachea is midline.  Regular rate and\nrhythm.  Patient was clear to auscultation with equal breath\nsounds.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  The\npelvis was stable.  The back had no step-offs or deformities.\nRectal tone was decreased, but guaiac negative.  Patient had\nfootdrop bilaterally with cool feet.  Right knee was swollen\nand both knees had abrasions.\n\nLABORATORIES:  Initial white cell count 9.5, hematocrit 38.8,\nplatelets 138.  Chem-7:  144, 4.2, 109, 24, 23, 1.1, glucose\n152, lactate 2.2.  The coags:  14, 29.2, and 1.3.  Fibrinogen\n225.  Amylase 145.\n\nHead CT at the outside hospital was negative.  C spine CT\nshowed a C2 fracture.  Abdomen and pelvis CT showed 4 x 4.5\ncm intramural thrombus, but no extravasation.  The bladder\nwas normal.\n\nX-rays of the right knee showed no fractures.  X-rays of the\nright hand show a questionable old fracture on the thumb.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma\nservice and monitored in the Intensive Care Unit.\nNeurosurgery was consulted immediately.  The Neurosurgery\nservice had strong concerns for a cervical cord contusion.\nThey requested a stat MRI and that the blood pressure be\ncontrolled for greater than 120 systolic.  They also\nrecommended the patient stay in the cervical collar, and that\nthe Solu-Medrol be given per protocol.\n\nDuring the initial part of the patient's admission, he was\nhemodynamically stable.  He required initially fluid and\npressors for blood pressure control, but stabilized within\nthe first day.  This is most likely due to volume contraction\nand neurologic shock.  The MR of the neck showed a cord\ncompression and contusion with a small epidural hematoma.\nNeurosurgery's recommendations included keeping his blood\npressure above 120 and to his keep his coagulation studies in\nthe normal range.\n\nOver the course of the next several days, the patient's\nneurologic status slightly improved.  He was alert, followed\ncommands, but was still considered quadriplegic.  The patient\ncan move his left side more than his right.  His strength in\nthe knee left was roughly a [**2-27**].\n\nOn [**1-12**], the patient's TLS were cleared\nradiographically.  Neurosurgery was slightly more optimistic\nin the sense that the patient can move his upper and lower\nextremities slightly more than previously.  The final read on\nthe TLS films were concerning for a questionable old fracture\nat the T5-T6 level.  Orthopedics was consulted, and\nrecommended logroll precautions, and a thoracic brace until\nthe patient could be extubated and evaluated clinically.\nThey felt that the fracture was an old fracture, and that he\ndid not require acute interventions.\n\nPlastic Surgery also evaluated the patient for the right hand\nfracture, which was deemed to be an old injury.  Their\nrecommendations were to follow the patient clinically, and\nthere was pain in all, in the right thumb, to splint the\nextremity.\n\nOn the [**1-13**], the patient was well enough to be\nextubated.  Due to the large amount of secretions, the\npatient was reintubated on the 21st.  At that time, the\npatient still remained pseudoquadriplegic.  He could breathe\nspontaneously and move his left upper extremity\nspontaneously, but had minimal movement in his legs or his\nright arm.\n\nOn the 22nd, a family meeting was convened, and it was\ndecided that the patient would continue with full support,\nand that we would hold on a tracheostomy and a PEG placement\nuntil the following week.  During that time, his neurologic\nstatus would be evaluated.  At that time, we would also have\na better idea regarding his prognosis.\n\nOn the [**1-16**], the patient had a lower extremity\nnoninvasive ultrasound, which showed no evidence of DVTs.\nThe patient also continued with aggressive diuresis, and his\nvent settings were changed to CPAP.  The patient continued to\nproduce a large amount of secretions and required assist\ncontrol for ventilation.  It was decided that the patient\nwould require a tracheostomy as his chances of weaning off\nthe vent are unrealistic.\n\nA second family meeting was held, and it was decided that the\npatient's wishes as dictated in his power of attorney would\nlimit the ICU team's actions.  His power of attorney stated\nthat the setting of the need for life support and/or heroic\nmeasures to keep him alive, his decision would be to withdraw\nsupport.\n\nAfter an extensive family meeting with the patient's son, it\nwas decided that the patient will be made DNR/DNI, and the\npatient will be extubated.  If the patient was stable, he\nwould continue with fully medical support.  If he became\nunstable, then he would be made CMO.  Patient was extubated\nand continued with respiratory distress due to the high\nsecretions.\n\nOn the [**1-24**], the patient continued with\nrespiratory distress, continued with the pseudoquadriplegia,\nand was becoming hemodynamically unstable.  A decision\nbetween the Trauma team, the ICU team, and the family was to\nmake the patient care measures only.\n\nOn the [**1-24**], the patient expired.  The family was\nnotified.\n\n\n\n                          [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 520**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 521**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 959**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2195-2-10**]  20:33\nT:  [**2195-2-11**]  05:56\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 53100**]\n",
