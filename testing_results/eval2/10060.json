Hypovolemia.\n5.  Respiratory failure.\n6.  Renal failure.\n\nPROCEDURE:  Total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy and\nHartmann pouch.\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:\n1.  Upright chest x-ray.\n2.  Abdominal flat plate.\n3.  CT scan of abdomen and pelvis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old\nfemale who presented to [**Hospital1 69**]\nemergency room with diffuse diarrhea and hypotension.\nPatient has a complicated past medical history including most\nrecently an admission for a pedestrian versus car accident\nwhere she suffered bilateral lower extremity fractures as\nwell as a C-2 fracture which required immobilization.\nPatient was eventually discharged to rehabilitation after\nhaving fasciotomy for compartment syndrome of her lower\nextremities.  She was being treated for multiple infections\nincluding urinary tract infection and pneumonia.  Patient\npresented to [**Hospital1 69**] emergency\nroom with a two day history of first constipation and then\ndiffuse diarrhea.  She had white count of 28,000 and\nabdominal tenderness.  A general surgery consult was\nobtained.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes status post MVC,\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Albuterol nebulizer p.r.n.,\nPrevacid 30 mg p.o. q.day, Synthroid 25 mcg p.o. q.day, Lasix\n20 mg p.o. q.day, Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.day, Lovenox 30 mg\nsubcutaneously b.i.d., Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Flagyl\n250 mg p.o. t.i.d., Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.six\nhours p.r.n., Senokot two tablets p.o. b.i.d., sodium\nbisacodyl 100 mg p.o. t.i.d., Fleet enema p.r.n., milk of\nmagnesia p.r.n., Tylenol p.r.n., Dulcolax p.r.n., Levaquin\n500 mg p.o. q.day, vancomycin 1 gm IV q.day, ceftriaxone 1 gm\nIV q.day.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature was 99.2,\nheart rate 108.  Initially blood pressure was 70/40, then\nimproved with 1 liter of saline to 90/60.  Respiratory rate\n36, sating 95% on a nonrebreathing face mask.  Patient\nappeared generally cachectic in severe distress with a\nhealing scar over the right eye and was in an immobilizing\n[**Location (un) 5622**] collar.  Pupils were reactive, equal to light.\nExtraocular movements intact.  Sclerae were anicteric.\nOropharynx was dry.  Carotids could not be palpated secondary\nto the collar.  Lungs were coarse bilaterally with expiratory\nwheezing bilaterally with diminishment at the bases.  Abdomen\nwas distended with diffuse tenderness most markedly in the\nupper quadrants.  Rectal exam was heme positive with diffuse\ndiarrhea, no masses.  Extremities were immobilized in knee\nimmobilizers and had 2+ pitting edema in the upper and lower\nextremities.  Patient was alert, oriented to person, place,\ntime and predicament.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  White count was 28.6, hematocrit 42,\nplatelet count 575.  PT 13.9, PTT 38.7, INR 1.3.  UA was\npositive for white cells and nitrites.  CKs were negative,\nbut with troponin of 1.  Sodium 127, potassium 4, chloride\n89, bicarb 21, BUN 36, creatinine 1.4 up from a baseline of\n0.9, glucose 114.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia with right\nbundle branch block with nonspecific ST depressions in V1 and\naVL.  KUB showed dilated loops of small bowel without\nevidence of obstruction.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral\npleural effusions with right lower lobe atelectasis.  First\ngas was pH 7.36, PCO2 36, PO2 71, bicarb 21 on 100%\nnonrebreather.  CT which was performed showed diffuse\nswelling and edema of her entire colon as well as her rectum\nwith ascites, but no free air, consistent with either toxic\nC.diff or ischemic colitis.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Initially after discussions with patient's\nand patient's proxy, she did not want surgical intervention,\nbut after multiple discussions and the likelihood that\nmedical therapy would not be successful, although the\nlikelihood of surgical therapy had a low chance of being\nsuccessful in her clinical condition, she elected for\nexploratory laparotomy and subtotal colectomy.  Patient was\nsurgically consented, taken to the operating room and through\na midline laparotomy, total abdominal colectomy was performed\nwith end ileostomy.  At the time of surgery there were large\namounts of ascites and a very edematous, but not perforated,\ncolon.  Patient was relatively stable during the operative\ncourse, but postoperatively in the intensive care unit she\nremained intubated and became fluid requiring and hypoxic.\nPatient required increasing doses of pressors.  Her kidney\nfunction deteriorated.\n\nAfter two days of aggressive therapy, the proxy determined\nthat given her multiorgan system failure, her age and her\ndesire not to have intubation and prolonged ICU intervention,\nshe was made comfort measures only.  Pressors were withdrawn\nand on [**2136-11-27**] at 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon patient expired\nand was pronounced.  Patient's proxy was informed.  There\nwere friends present during the expiration.  Final diagnoses\nas above including ischemic colitis with sepsis and\nmultisystem organ failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          [**Name6 (MD) 2467**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10404**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 10405**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 33621**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2136-11-27**]  15:44\nT:  [**2136-11-30**]  10:13\nJOB#:  [**Job Number **]\n",
