Wife thinks it was a\nmechanical fall.  No head trauma.  No LOC.  He was noted to have\nan acute MS change within 30 minutes.  T=101.8 upon arriving to\nOSH ED.  Electively intubated for airway protection and\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 18**].\n.\nED COURSE:\n-- U/A - 11-20 WBCs, occasional bacteria\n-- WBCs - 28.9 w/ 91% lymphs\n-- UCx and BCx sent\n-- ceftriaxone and vancomycin started\n-- CXR - Abnormal opacity involving both lungs. The finding\nrepresents both airspace and interstitial disease. Diagnostic\nconsiderations include pulmonary edema in the setting of chronic\ninterstitial changes. Bilateral pleural effusions are present as\nwell.\n-- CT CHEST - Severe emphysema and moderate pulmonary edema.\nLeft lower lobe consolidation could represent pneumonia,\naspiration or atelectasis. Mild stranding in left upper quadrant\naround the splenic flexure of uncertain etiology.\n-- CT HEAD - negative\n-- EKG - sinus tachycardia, PVCs, nl axis, nl intervals, no\nsignificant ST interval or T wave changes.\n.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nPMH:\n-- PAF\n-- htn\n-- dyslipidemia\n-- Transitional Cell bladder CA -- BCG tx\n-- Lung mass (seen on staging CT [**7-/2106**]) -- left lower lobe\n4x4x3cm, concerning for malignancy.  pt has to present refused\nintervention.\n-- TTE ([**7-18**]) - NL LV size and function, EF=60-65%.\n-- glaucoma\n-- osteoporosis\n.\n\n\nSocial History:\nlives with wife.\n.\n\n\nFamily History:\n non-contributory\n.\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVENT:  Vt=550, Pressure=10, PEEP=5, FiO2=50, RR=20\nT=100.2\nBP=120/70\nHR=90\nRR=20\nO2sat=97%\nGEN:  lying in bed intubated, sedated\nHEENT:  no lad\nCV:  rrr\nPULMO: ctab anteriorly\nABD:  bs+, nt, nd\nEXT:  warm, no c/c/e\nNEURO:  pinpoint pupils, reactive, b/l.  reactive to painful\nstimuli.  moving all extremities, but not to command.  toes are\nneither upgoing or downgoing.\n.\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nMRI [**2107-1-24**]:IMPRESSION:\n1.  Multiple punctate foci of increased diffusion signal are\nsuggestive of multiple watershed infarcts in the cortex between\nthe MCA/ACA distribution and MCA/PCA distribution.  This could\nbe secondary to an episode of global hypotension and/or hypoxia.\n\n2.  No evidence of intracranial mass.\n3.  Left choroid plexus xanthogranuloma.\n4.

He\nwas noted to have had a fall complicated by altered mental\nstatus. Non-contrast head CT was negative for intracranial\nbleed. There was high concern for an infectious process due to a\nleukocytosis.  CT torso revealed no focal inectious etiology.\nThe patient was noted to have a positive UA and a question of a\npneumonia. The patient was initiated on ceftriaxone and vanco at\nmeningeal dosing. LP was not done due to elevated INR and\nminimal clinical indications. MRI/A of the head on the day of\nadmission revealed numerous watershed infarcts. These were felt\nto be consistent with either an episode of hypotension (which\nthe patient was not known to have had) or embolic phenomena. The\npatient was known to have A. Fib but TTE did not reveal any\nintra-cardiac thrombi. The patient was already fully\nanticoagulated on admission and heparin gtt was initaited at the\ntime of infarct discovery. It is possible that the patient is\nhypercoaguable secondary to malignancy. Repeat MRI/A on hospital\nday 4 revealed progression of the patient's infarcted area. He\nwas successfully weaned from the ventilator. After discussion\nwith the family regarding the patient's poor prognosis, he was\nadvanced to comfort measures only and transferred to the\nmedicine floor service. On the medicine service he received\nativan, morphine and scopolamine as needed for comfort. The\npatient expired at 09:55AM on [**2107-2-1**] when he was found to have\nno pulse, no spontaneous breaths and no pupillary reflex. The\npatient's family was contact[**Name (NI) **].
