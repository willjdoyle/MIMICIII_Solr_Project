Irrigation and\ndebridement of left lower leg. Irrigation and debridement left\nMorel lesion thigh and flank.\n[**2142-6-18**] Circumferential debridement from the gluteal fold to\nthe ankle of the skin, subcutaneous tissue of left leg with the\nproximal control of the saphenous vein and application of\ndressing.\n[**2142-6-19**] Debridement of the left leg with vac placement\n[**2142-6-25**] Debridement of the left leg\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\n59 year old male who was riding his motorcycle.  He was hit by a\ndrunk driver.  He was thrown 50 feet.  Helmet was intact but\nunknown loss of conscience.\nHe sustained multiple injuries:\n- large degloving injury to left leg\n- L proximal fibula nondisplaced fracture\n- R elbow abrasion that enters olecranon bursa\n- L scapular body fracture\n- R lateral rib fx 3,4,5,6\n- L non-displaced buckling rib fx 4,5,6\n- Spinous process fractures T8-11\n- L eyebrow laceration\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nAlcohol use, although no recent abuse known.\nCirrhosis, portal hypertension, without known hepatitis C status\n\nSocial History:\ndivorced x2 but supportive girlfriend, family in area.\nETOH abuse in the past.\nOccupation: car salesman\n\nFamily History:\nUnknown\n\nPhysical Exam:\nExpired.\n\nPertinent Results:\n[**2141-6-16**]:\nCT Head: No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.\nCT C-spine: Mid-cervical spondylosis, without fracture or\nlisthesis\nCT Abdomen and Pelvis: 1. Multiple osseous injuries including\nbilateral rib fractures and lower thoracic spinous process\nfractures. Left scapular inferior body fracture also noted.\n2. Cirrhosis with splenomegaly, suggesting portal hypertension.\n\n3. Periportal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, with\nprominent mediastinal nodes, of unknown etiology. While\ncirrhosis may explain some of these findings, follow-up CT is\nrecommended to help exclude neoplasm, such as lymphoma.\n4. Right basilar consolidation more likely represents\natelectasis than\naspiration.\n5. Chronically occluded left common iliac artery, with\nreconstitution of the left external iliac artery.\n[**2142-6-25**] Abdominal Ultrasound: No ascites in upper abdomen.\nLower abdomen obscured by bowel gas.\n[**2142-6-26**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis: 1. Pneumatosis coli of the\nascending, descending, and sigmoid colon. Intraluminal air also\nwithin portions of the distal small bowel. While ischemia is in\nthe differential, given that the patient is intubated and has a\nsignificant amount of subcutaneous air secondary to trauma, the\netiology maybe non- ischemic. Small amount of intrahepatic air,\nlikely in the biliary system.\n2. Increased ascites.\n3. Increased, predominantly basilar, lung consolidations\nbilaterally.\n4. Multiple fractures as described above including probable\nnondisplaced\nfracture of the right acetabulum.\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 19484**] is a 58 year-old man with no confirmed medical\nhistory who was admitted to trauma ICU [**2142-6-15**] after a\nmotorcycle crash on the early morning of the same day.  He was\nthrown 50 feet from his motorcycle after collision with\nautomobile, was wearing a helmet, but sustained multiple\ninjuries:\n- large degloving injury to left leg\n- L proximal fibula nondisplaced fracture\n- R elbow abrasion that enters olecranon bursa\n- L scapular body fracture\n- R lateral rib fx 3,4,5,6\n- L non-displaced buckling rib fx 4,5,6\n- Spinous process fractures T8-11\n- L eyebrow laceration\n\n  On [**2142-6-15**] patient went to the OR for two procedures. First\nprocedure was for an exposed right elbow joint.  This was washed\nout then closed.  The second procedure was irrigation and\ndebridement of a left Morel-[**Doctor Last Name 83285**] lesion (\"A variant of a true\nopen fracture is an extensive lumbosacral fascial degloving\ninjury similar to that described in Morel-[**Doctor Last Name 83285**] syndrome\") of\nthe pelvis, lower torso, thigh.\nTwo wound vacs were placed in the upper and lower leg. He was\naggressively resuscitated after the OR in which he lost 1500cc\nof blood.  Through this admission he had a total of 14 units of\nPRBCS, 2 bags of plateletes, 5 units of FFP and one unit of\ncryopercipate. Repeat CT scan on the day of admission of his\nabdomen and pelvis due to his hypotension which was negative for\ninjury or any source of bleeding.  On [**2142-6-17**] he was started on\nTubefeeds.  On [**2142-6-18**] he was taken back to the OR for further\ndebridement of necrotic skin and subcutaneous tissue (entirety\nof skin excised) from gluteal fold to ankle, with wet to dry\ndressing placed. [**2142-6-19**] he returned to the OR for further\ndebridement, washout and placement of a wound vac.  He continued\nto have high output (>3 Liters/daily) throughout the hospital\nstay.  On [**2142-6-22**] wound vac was changed at the bedside. On\n[**2142-6-24**] the patient started to spike high fevers.  Blood\nculture one out of 4 bottles grew out Ecoli.  He had a new\ncentral line placed and cultures were drawn.  On [**2142-6-25**]\npatient's total bili continued to increase.  Patient started to\ngo into renal failure.  Patient developed a rigid abdomen and\nhad a bladder pressure of 34.  Bladder pressure decreased to 15\nafter a large bowel movement.  Patient was started on pressures.\n Lactate started to increase.  [**2142-6-26**] Concern that the leg\nwas causing sepsis patient went to the OR for leg debridement\nand washout of the left lower extremity.  The necrotic tissue\nwas debrided but felt that this was not enough to cause him to\nbe deterriotating so quickly.  He then got a CT scan of his\nabdomen and pelvis which showed Pneumatosis coli of the\nascending, descending, and sigmoid colon.  At this point it was\nfelt that he had non-survivable injuries.  A discussion was had\nwith the family in which it was decided to make him comfort\nmeasures.  Pressors were stopped. Fentanyl drip was increased\nand ventilatory support was withdrawn. He expired shortly after\nthat.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\nNone\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nMulti-organ system failure status post motorcycle crash\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nDeath\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nNone\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nNone\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2142-6-27**]",
