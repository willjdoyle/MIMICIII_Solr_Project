The crash occured at low\nspeeds with no trauma noted to driver.  EMS arrived and noted\nthat the patient was altered and agitated and required\nbenzodiazepines for sedation.  She was transported to an OSH\nwhere she was intubated to allow for CT imaging.  CT at OSH\nsuggested a question of a brain aneurysm or mass.  She was\nhypotensive at the OSH and was started on phenylephrine; the\nthought was she had dropped her pressures because of sedation.\nShe was quickly weaned off pressors, and then transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. Upon arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**],\nshe had repeated imaging of her head which revealed no aneurysm\nor bleed, however there was noted left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] meningioma\nwhich is potentially chronic.  She was noted to be unresponsive\noff sedation, with no response to sternal rub.  She was also\nbradycardic to the 40s and hypothermic, requiring bair hugger.\nA bedside echo was done which showed good contractility despite\nthe bradycardia.  Given a question of an elevated TSH at the\nOSH, she received 500 mcg of T4 in the ED; she was then admitted\nto the MICU for unresponsiveness.  At time of arrival to MICU,\nher HR was 110, BP was 120/70, and she was hypothermic with temp\nof 95.\nOf note, upon review of her history briefly with family in ED,\nthey noted that she had increasing difficulty with walking,\ntalking, and motor activities sub-acutely over the past two\nweeks.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nunknown\n\nSocial History:\nunknown\n\nFamily History:\nunknown\n\nPhysical Exam:\nADMISSION EXAM\nVS: HR 110, BP 130/70, RR 14, temp 97.6, 98% on 50% FiO2\nGen: Caucasian female in no apparent distress\nNeuro: Corneal reflexes intact, pupils round, reactive to light,\ndoll's eye intact; no response to threat, no response to sternal\nrub, does withdraw to pain in extremities\nCardiac: Nl s1/s2, RRR\nPulm: lungs clear in anterior lung fields\nAbd: soft, nontender nondistended\nExt: depressed reflexes, no edema noted\n\nDISCHARGE EXAM\n[patient expired]\n\nPertinent Results:\nADMISSION LABS\n[**2184-12-28**] 07:30PM BLOOD WBC-6.8 RBC-3.37* Hgb-10.2* Hct-30.2*\nMCV-90 MCH-30.2 MCHC-33.6 RDW-15.8* Plt Ct-106*\n[**2184-12-29**] 12:30AM BLOOD Neuts-78.9* Lymphs-17.5* Monos-3.2\nEos-0.3 Baso-0.1\n[**2184-12-28**] 07:30PM BLOOD PT-11.4 PTT-34.6 INR(PT)-1.1\n[**2184-12-29**] 12:30AM BLOOD Glucose-98 UreaN-18 Creat-1.0 Na-146*\nK-4.1 Cl-113* HCO3-26 AnGap-11\n[**2184-12-29**] 12:30AM BLOOD ALT-54* AST-72* LD(LDH)-239 CK(CPK)-711*\nAlkPhos-96 TotBili-0.2\n[**2184-12-28**] 07:30PM BLOOD Lipase-70*\n[**2184-12-28**] 07:30PM BLOOD cTropnT-0.03*\n[**2184-12-31**] 04:39PM BLOOD CK-MB-2 cTropnT-<0.01\n[**2184-12-28**] 07:30PM BLOOD Calcium-9.4 Phos-1.9* Mg-1.7\n[**2184-12-28**] 07:30PM BLOOD TSH-7.7*\n[**2184-12-29**] 12:30AM BLOOD T4-15.6* T3-126 Free T4-2.7*\n[**2184-12-28**] 07:30PM BLOOD ASA-NEG Ethanol-NEG Acetmnp-NEG\nBnzodzp-NEG Barbitr-NEG Tricycl-NEG\n\n[**2184-12-28**] EEG\nThis is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG because of marked\ndiffuse attenuation of background with no clearly discernible\ncerebral\nelectrical activity. These findings are indicative of severe\ndiffuse\nencephalopathy which could be due to a variety of causes\nincluding\nsevere hypoxic/ischemic injury and effects of sedative\nmedications.\nClose clinical monitoring and bedside EEG monitoring is\nrecommended to\nevaluate for change or improvement.

Bilateral acute and subacute infarctions in a watershed and\nembolic\npattern of distribution.\n2. Calcified suprasellar lesion, which could represent a\ncraniopharyngioma or a thrombosed aneurysm. No definite\nconnection to the circle of [**Location (un) **] is seen on the MRA.\n3. Meningioma in the left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**].\n4. Probable cavernoma in the right posterior limb of the\ninternal capsule.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Last Name (Titles) 50955**] is a 79y/o lady with 2-3 weeks of subtle decline\nin mental status who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH\nintubated after a motor vehicle collision.  She did not have any\nsevere injuries, but was noted to be in a coma despite weaning\noff sedation completely.  her neurologic exam fluctuated, with\nintermittent loss of brainstem functions (gag, pupillary\nreaction).  Neurology was consulted and felt that her exam was\nconsistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.  EEG confirmed\nabnormalities, and she was started on antiepileptics.  MRI\nsuggested watershed infarcts which support the theory of\nhypotensive damage, though no hypotension was documented prior\nto her transfer.  She was observed for 5 days with minimal\nimprovement and Neurology believed that her likelihood of a full\nrecovery was dismal.  Family meetings were held with the MICU\nteam, patient's niece and nephew [**Doctor Last Name 2048**] and [**Name (NI) 16917**]) as well as\nphone conversations with patient's brother [**Name (NI) 122**].  It was\ndecided that in the case of severe hypoxic damage, she would not\nwant to be kept alive artificially.  The patient was extubated\non [**2185-1-2**] and expired on [**2185-1-4**]. The case was waived by the\nMedical Examiner and an autopsy was not requested by her health\ncare proxy.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nunknown\n\nDischarge Medications:\n[patient expired]\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n[patient expired]\n\nDischarge Condition:\n[patient expired]\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n[patient expired]\n\nFollowup Instructions:\n[patient expired]\n\n\n",
