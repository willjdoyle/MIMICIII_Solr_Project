Evaluate for carotid canal injury.\n\nTECHNIQUE: CT of the head was performed.\n\nFINDINGS: There is a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter with\nthe tip in the third ventricle.\n\nThe non-contrast head CT again shows diffuse subarachnoid\nhemorrhage and extensive cranial fractures as previously\ndescribed. Please refer to that report for discussion of these\nfindings.\n\nOn the CTA, there is no significant abnormality of the right\ncarotid artery within the carotid canal. However, the cavernous\nsegment of the internal carotid artery does appear slightly\nnarrowed compared to the right. It also appears slightly\nnarrowed relative to its middle cerebral artery branch segments.\nIn addition, at its anterior genu, there is a 2 mm hyperdensity\nwhich may represent a tiny aneurysm. This could also represent a\nsmall area of intramural contrast leakage, which would represent\na dissection. Confirmation of this finding could be obtained by\ncerebral angiography. However, flow is present distally into the\nmiddle and anterior cerebral artery branches.\n\nThe left internal carotid artery appears normal along its entire\nsegment. The vertebral arteries appear also normal as does the\nbasilar artery. The anterior, middle and posterior cerebral\narteries appear unremarkable. This study is somewhat limited due\nto a large amount of venous phase contamination.\n\nIMPRESSION: Slight narrowing of the right internal carotid\nartery in its cavernous segment. Near the anterior genu, there\nis a 2 mm area of contrast which could represent a small\nintramural leak versus a small aneurysm. If an intramural leak\nis present, this would be consistent with a dissection.\nEvaluation with cerebral angiography would be needed to\ndistinguish these two findings.\n\nThe remainder of the intracranial circulation shows no evidence\nof dissection or thrombosis.\n.\n.\nCT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST\n\nReason: eval for blunt injury, eval t/l/s spine\nField of view: 48 Contrast: OPTIRAY\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n40 year old woman with [**Hospital 8751**] and head injury\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\neval for blunt injury, eval t/l/s spine\nCONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.\n\nHISTORY: 40-year-old woman status post MVC with severe head\ntrauma.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the chest, abdomen and\npelvis were obtained with IV contrast. 120 cc Optiray. Coronal\nand sagittal reformatted images were obtained.\n\nCT CHEST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within\nnormal limits. There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar\nlymphadenopathy. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Emphysematous\nchanges are noted in the lungs. There is no evidence of\npneumothorax. No pleural or pericardial effusions are\nidentified.\n\nCT ABDOMEN: The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal\nglands, kidneys, stomach, and bowel loops are unremarkable.\nNasogastric tube is identified. There is no free air or free\nfluid. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is\nidentified.\n\nCT PELVIS: Foley catheter is inserted in the bladder. The\nuterus, adnexa, sigmoid colon, and rectum are unremarkable.\nThere is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal\nlymphadenopathy.\n\nBONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous\nlesions. No fractures are identified. The thoracic and lumbar\nspine are normal in\nappearance and alignment without evidence of fracture or\ndislocation.\n\nIMPRESSION: No acute injuries identified in the chest, abdomen,\nand pelvis.\n.\n.\nCT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2172-10-3**] 12:31 AM\n\nCT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST\n\nReason: eval for fx\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n40 year old woman with [**Hospital 8751**] and head injury\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\neval for fx\nCONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.\n\nHISTORY: 40-year-old woman status post motor vehicle accident\nand severe head trauma.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the cervical spine were\nobtained without contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted\nimages were obtained.\n\nFINDINGS: There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture or\nabnormal alignment of the component vertebrae. Vertebral body\nand disc heights are preserved. There are small amounts of\nextramedullary blood tracking along the cervical cord. There is\nno prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Emphysematous changes are\nnoted at the lung apices. Endotracheal and orogastric tubes are\nnoted.\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of cervical spine fracture.\nExtramedullary blood tracking along the cervical cord is\nsubarachnoid blood related to the patient's intracranial\nhemorrhage.\n\n.\n.\nCT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2172-10-3**] 12:30 AM\n\nCT HEAD W/O CONTRAST\n\nReason: eval fx, bleed, mass effect\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n40 year old woman with [**Hospital 8751**] and head injury\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\neval fx, bleed, mass effect\nCONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.\n\nHISTORY: 40-year-old woman status post MVC with severe head\ntrauma.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.\n\nFINDINGS: There is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is no\nmass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline\nstructures. Scattered foci of pneumocephalus are identified.\nThere are extensive comminuted cranial fractures extending\nlongitudinally from the right temporal bone, across the sphenoid\nthrough to a left longitudinal temporal bone fracture. The\nfractures involve both carotid canals. Blood and air is seen in\nthe sella. A fracture fragment is seen in the left external and\nmiddle ear canals. There is likely ossicular disruption. A large\namount of blood is seen in the sphenoid and left maxillary\nsinuses. A subgaleal hematoma and contusion is noted over the\nleft posterior parietooccipital region. Note is made of\ndiastasis of the lambdoid suture on that side.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n2. Extensive cranial fractures including extension through both\ntemporal and sphenoid bones.\n\n.\n.\nBRAIN SCAN\n\nReason: 35 YR OLD WOMEN WITH SEVERE HEAD INJURY, LOSS OF CRANIAL\nNERVES, EVAL FOR INTERCRANIAL FLOW\n\nRADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:\n27.0 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Neurolite;\nHISTORY: 35 year old woman with severe head injury and loss of\ncranial nerves.\n\nFINDINGS:\n\nFollowing injection of tracer, dynamic flow and static planar\nimages of the\nbrain were obtained in multiple projections.

Purulent fluid from the lungs.\n\nIMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-3**]:\n\nLarge areas of bibasilar consolidation, increased on the left\nthan on the right are consistent with a severe pneumonia. Heart\nsize is normal. Small left pleural effusion may have developed.\nNo pneumothorax. The left subclavian line projects over the SVC.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis patient was admitted under the trauma service on [**2172-10-3**].\nDetails of the exact sequence of events of her situation are not\nknown, but it was known she jumped out of a high-speed moving\nvehicle as a passenger and sustained an open head injury. In the\nhospital, her brain scans showed massive intracranial injuries,\nwith near-compressed ventricles. She was intubated, paralyzed\nand sedated. Her initial CT head showed a diffuse subarachnoid\nhemorrhage and a hinge fracture of the base of the skull through\nbilateral carotid fossa. An intracranial bolt was placed by the\nneurosurgery service.  Her intracranial pressures remained\nconsistently high, despite various medical management attempts.\nHer clinical examination was futile and despite aggressive\nmedical management, she had a brain herniation and subsequently\nbecame brain dead. With appropriate steps, she underwent organ\ndonation. She was prounounced dead on [**2172-10-6**] at 1630.\n\nDischarge Medications:\nShe was prounounced dead on [**2172-10-6**] at 1630.\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nShe was prounounced dead on [**2172-10-6**] at 1630.\n\nDischarge Condition:\nShe was prounounced dead on [**2172-10-6**] at 1630.\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nShe was prounounced dead on [**2172-10-6**] at 1630.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nShe was prounounced dead on [**2172-10-6**] at 1630.\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2172-10-8**]",
