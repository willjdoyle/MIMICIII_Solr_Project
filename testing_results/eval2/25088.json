Status post motorcycle crash, blunt trauma with massive\n    liver laceration, probable closed head injury.\n2.  Laceration of small bowel mesentery.\n3.  Intraoperative death.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 29-year-old\nmale who reportedly struck a tree with his motorcycle. He was\nagonal at the scene and brought by EMS to the emergency\ndepartment where extensive resuscitation was performed. The\npatient was hypoxic with agonal breathing and was emergently\nintubated. Bilateral chest tubes were placed in the emergency\ndepartment. He did at some point have a cardiac arrest, and\nATLS protocol was initiated.\n\nThe patient was brought emergently to the operating room\nafter chest x-ray revealed that the right chest tube appeared\nto be below the diaphragm.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a GCS of 5. He was\nconfused. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nHis abdomen was soft and distended. He had a gross deformity\nof his right lower extremity.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated in the\ntrauma bay. He was emergently intubated, and a large bore\naccess was placed, as were bilateral chest tubes. Given the\nfact that the right chest tube appeared to be below the\ndiaphragm, and the patient was actively coding, he was\nresuscitated and brought emergently to the operating room.\n\nExploratory laparotomy was performed with a repair of a liver\nlaceration. He also had a laceration of the small bowel\nmesentery. The abdomen was packed. He was resuscitated,\nmassively receiving 15 units of blood in the operating room.\nThe patient continued to be unstable throughout the procedure\ndropping his blood pressure.\n\nWe decided to do a transabdominal pericardiotomy to ensure\nthat there was no tamponade, which there was not. The aorta\nwas cross-clamped and held to maintain his blood pressure;\nhowever, the patient continued to be intermittently\nbradycardic and hypotensive and finally sustained a cardiac\narrest which he could not be resuscitated.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Death.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\n1.  Status post motorcycle crash with blunt trauma, massive\n    liver laceration and probable closed head injury.\n2.  Laceration of small bowel mesentery.\n3.  Blood loss anemia.\n4.  Intraoperative death.\n\n\n\n                        [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], MD  [**MD Number(2) 62938**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 56208**]\nMEDQUIST36\nD:  [**2131-1-12**] 09:26:05\nT:  [**2131-1-12**] 09:42:44\nJob#:  [**Job Number 62939**]\n",
