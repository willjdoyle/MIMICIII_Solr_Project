    "note_text": "Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 60907**]\nAdmission Date: [**2150-4-6**]\nDischarge Date: [**2150-4-22**]\nDate of Birth:  [**2109-6-6**]\nSex:  M\nService:  TRA\n\n\nADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Multiple trauma.\n\nMr. [**Known lastname 1557**] was a 40-year-old male who was brought into the\nemergency room on the day of admission after a motorcycle\ncrash. He had been helmeted and crashes his motorcycle on the\nhighway. Subsequently, he stood up and was struck by an\noncoming car. This car did not stop at the scene, but\npedestrians phoned EMS. He was med flighted to the [**Hospital1 18**] and\nen route became hypotensive and was intubated. Also en route,\nhe had angiocath decompression of his left chest, and he was\nfelt to have a pneumothorax.\n\nOn arrival to the trauma bay, his hemodynamics were unstable,\nand he was tachycardic and hypotensive. He had bilateral\nchest tubes placed. He had an obvious right femur deformity\nand pelvic instability on exam. He had gross hematuria upon\nplacement of the Foley. He had his pelvis wrapped in a sheet\nfor stability, and with ongoing hemodynamic instability and\nthe requirement of blood transfusions and crystalloid, he had\na diagnostic peritoneal lavage done. This revealed no gross\nblood, and white count and red count later came back at 156\nand 62,500 respectively.\n\nHis chest x-ray revealed a right scapular fracture, left\nclavicular fracture, multiple bilateral rib fractures, and\nsubcutaneous air. Pelvic fracture revealed an open-book\npelvis with a wide diastasis. Significant labs were that of a\nhematocrit of 26.4, a lactate of 6.9, and a creatinine of\n1.7.\n\nAfter initial resuscitation and after interpretation of the\ndiagnostic peritoneal lavage as being negative, he was taken\nto the angio suite, where he had bilateral internal pudendal\narteries and bilateral anterior gluteal arteries embolized\nfor active bleeding. He also had an aortogram of the arch to\nrule out any aortic injury. He was brought to the ICU, where\nhe continued to be hemodynamically unstable requiring nearly\n30 units of pack cells in total, and 22 units of plasma, and\n22 units of platelets. His lactate remained elevated and his\nblood pressure was still not stable. His abdomen had become\ndistended, and the following morning, he was taken for CT\nscan. On CT scan, he had a gross amount of fluid in the\nabdomen consistent with blood and was felt to be\nextravasating from his spleen.\n\nHe was taken immediately to the operating room where\nexploratory laparotomy was performed and a splenectomy done.\nAlso in the operating room, there was an external fixator\nplaced by orthopedics on his pelvis as well as his femur. He\nstabilized to some degree after that, and was brought back to\nthe intensive care unit. His significant events from that\npoint included an inferior vena cava filter that was placed\non hospital day 3 for prophylaxis against the complications\nof DVT. He had returned to the operating room on hospital day\n#5 for internal fixation of his femur and pelvis. On hospital\nday #6, he returned to the operating room for closure of his\nabdomen.\n\nInitially, his abdomen had been left open and secured with a\n[**Location (un) 5701**] bag as he was too distended to be closed. From a\nneurological standpoint, he was showing some evidence of\nmovement and had a CAT scan of his head that showed no\ndamage. His kidneys were starting to show evidence of\nfailure, and he had rhabdomyolysis with elevated CKs, which\nwas being treated with alkalinization of his urine.\n\nOn approximately hospital day #10, after attempts at\nventilator weaning had failed, decision was made to place a\npercutaneous tracheostomy tube. After discussions with the\nfamily and consent was obtained, this was attempted at the\nbedside. This was complicated by mild hypoxia in conjunction\nwith hyperkalemia that led to a cardiac arrest. CPR was\ninitiated immediately, and he regained a rhythm and a blood\npressure. Subsequent to that event, his neurologic status\ndeteriorated, and he slowly showed worsening of brainstem\nfunction. He was kept ventilated with a tracheostomy for the\ndays to follow.\n\nHis gastrointestinal system was intact for feeding purposes,\nbut he did have an elevated bilirubin in the mid portion of\nhis hospital course as high as 28. This was presumed to be\nfrom his massive blood transfusion requirement. His bilirubin\ncame down, but later in his course after the cardiac arrest,\nhe started to have an elevation of his transaminases. On\nconsulting with cardiology and hepatology, it was felt that\nthis was secondary to right heart failure that had come about\nafter his cardiac arrest. They had no specific prescription\nfor this.\n\nFrom an infectious disease standpoint, he had multiple\ncultures taken for intermittent fevers throughout his\nadmission. He had blood cultures that grew out both coag-\nnegative Staph and later vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.\nThis is treated initially with vancomycin until the\nenterococcal species came back, and he was eventually changed\nto linezolid. All lines were changed appropriately, and at\nthe time of discharge, those results are still pending.\n\nOn the weekend prior to his eventual expiration, he underwent\na MRI of his head and spine as his neurological condition was\nnot improving and there was some note of decreased rectal\ntone to go alone with the spiking fevers that he was having.\nThere was some concern that he had hypoxic brain injury as\nwell as a small concern that he could have a spinal cord\nabscess causing neurological dysfunction and fever. While in\nthe MRI scanner, despite frequent suctioning, he had mild\nepisodes of hypoxia and again in the setting of some mild\nhyperkalemia, experienced a second cardiac arrest. Of note,\nhe had been undergoing daily hemodialysis around this time to\ncombat this hyperkalemia. This arrest lasted approximately 3\nminutes, and he was stabilized and again brought to the\nintensive care unit.\n\nHe subsequently had worsening of his neurologic status and\nneurology became involved. Because of the arrest, the MRI of\nthe head was never completed. On neurological exam, he\neventually lost nearly all brainstem reflexes including cold\ncalorics, corneals, and pupillary reflexes. He had an EEG\ndone, which showed severe diffuse encephalopathy, but did not\nnecessarily fulfill the criteria for lack of cerebral\nactivity.\n\nOn the morning of his eventual demise, he underwent an apnea\ntest, which he passed. He, after approximately 1.5 minutes\noff the ventilator, did start to have spontaneous\nrespirations. Therefore, the criteria for brain death was not\nmet. Subsequent to this, a family meeting took place after\nconsulting with nephrology between the family, the ICU team,\nand the trauma team. After long discussion as to his current\ncondition and grave prognosis, the family decided to pursue\ncomfort measures only and withdrew ventilator support. He\nexpired shortly thereafter. The medical examiner was\ncontact[**Name (NI) **] and accepted the case for postmortem examination.\n\nDATE OF EXPIRATION:  [**2150-4-22**]\n\n\n\n                        [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5732**], [**MD Number(1) 5733**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 60908**]\nMEDQUIST36\nD:  [**2150-4-22**] 16:43:22\nT:  [**2150-4-23**] 08:32:59\nJob#:  [**Job Number 60909**]\n\n\n\n",
