The patient had\n[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale of 3 at the scene and was intubated by\nemergency personnel.\n\nThe patient was transferred via Life Flight to the [**Hospital1 1444**] with bradycardia and\nhypertension.  The patient had a positive left lower\nextremity deformity with external rotation of the leg and\nshortening.  The patient did have a prolonged extrication\ntime of over 15 minutes, during which a presumed anoxic\ninjury occurred.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Previous facial reconstruction after\na traumatic event during a baseball game.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol.  No smoking.  No recreational\ndrugs (per the family).\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Initial vital signs\nrevealed the patient's temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit,\nhis blood pressure was 115/20, his heart rate was 65,\nrespiratory rate revealed intubated and Ambu bag ventilated,\nand his oxygen saturation was 98%.   [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale in\nthe Trauma Bay was 3.  Pupils were 3 mm and fixed.  The\noropharynx was clear.  The tympanic membranes were clear.\nCardiovascular examination revealed bradycardia at 40.  The\nlungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.   Chest\nrevealed no deformities or tenderness.  The abdomen was soft,\nnontender, and nondistended.  The pelvis was stable.  Flank\nrevealed no deformities.  No costovertebral angle tenderness.\nBack revealed no deformities.  Cervical spine revealed no\ndeformities, stepoff, or tenderness.  Thoracolumbosacral\nrevealed no deformities, stepoff, or tenderness.  Rectal\nexamination was guaiac-negative.  Upper extremities revealed\nno major deformities.  Positive ecchymosis over the left\nelbow.  Right lower extremity revealed no deformities.  Left\nlower extremity revealed positive external rotation of the\nleg and shortening.  Pulse examination revealed 2+ radial,\nfemoral, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses.  No\npalpable abdominal masses.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial blood\ngas was 7.48/22/380/17/4.  White blood cell count was 7.8,\nhis hematocrit was 31.3, and his platelets were 133.\nChemistry-7 revealed his sodium was 139, potassium was 3,\nchloride was 116, blood urea nitrogen was 12, creatinine was\n0.6, and his blood glucose was 140.  Coagulations revealed\nhis prothrombin time was 15.5, his partial thromboplastin\ntime was 33, and his INR was 1.6.  His amylase was 31.\n\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest and pelvic x-rays were\nwithin normal limits.\n\nCervical spine was within normal limits.\n\nFAST was within normal limits.\n\nA computed tomography of the head showed positive midbrain\nand brain stem intraparenchymal bleed.\n\nA computed tomography of the neck revealed no signs of\nfractures.\n\nA computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a grade 2\nsplenic laceration.\n\nA computed tomography of the pelvis showed no fractures.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted\nto the Trauma Intensive Care Unit for initial resuscitation.\n\nNeurosurgery was consulted while Life Flight was en route.\nThey had decided that the patient would benefit from a\nintraventricular drain.\n\nThe Orthopaedic Service was consulted and concluded that the\nleft femur fracture would require an open reduction/internal\nfixation when the patient was stable.\n\nNeurosurgery's initial recommendations were that the\npatient's prognosis was grave and that there was very little\nchance of a meaningful recovery.  During that time, the\npatient's family was called numerous times.  The [**Hospital1 1559**]\nPolice Department was notified and assisted in finding the\nnext of [**Doctor First Name **].\n\nDuring the patient's initial hospital stay, a central and\narterial line were placed.  The intraventricular drain was\nplaced by the Neurosurgery Service without complications.\nThe Orthopaedic Service placed the patient in Buck's traction\nto extend the left lower extremity.\n\nVascular Surgery was consulted due to the patient's\nunilateral ankle-brachial index of the lower extremities.\nAfter Buck's traction was applied, the patient's\nankle-brachial index returned to 1.\n\nOn hospital day one, a family meeting was convened.  The\ngrave prognosis was relayed to the family.  Due to the grave\nprognosis, it was decided that the patient's femur fracture\nwould not be addressed pending his disposition.\n\nDuring the second hospital day, the patient's intracranial\npressure increased to 35.  The patient was given additional\ndoses of mannitol.  The repeat head computed tomography\nshowed worsening/blossoming of the brain stem and midbrain\nintraparenchymal bleeds.  Neurosurgery concluded that this\nwas an unrecoverable injury.\n\nThese findings were relayed to the family during an in-depth\nfamily meeting involving the Trauma Service, Intensive Care\nUnit Service, and Neurosurgery Service.  During that time, it\nwas decided that the patient would be made do not\nresuscitate/do not intubate but would continue full medical\nsupport.\n\nOn hospital day three, the patient's intraparenchymal\npressures had increased regardless of the use of mannitol.\nThe patient's neurologic examination continued unchanged, as\nthe patient was unresponsive.\n\nOn hospital day three, the family decided that they would\nmake the patient comfort measures only and that the patient\nshould be an organ donor.\n\nOn [**1-1**], the patient was made comfort measures only.\nHe was started on a morphine drip for comfort.  The Organ\nBank was notified, and the Transplant Service was notified.\nEarly on [**1-1**], the patient expired and was an organ\ndonor.\n\nCHIEF CAUSE OF DEATH:  Traumatic brain injury followed by a\ncardiac death.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 11889**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 959**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2163-1-14**]  08:08\nT:  [**2163-1-14**]  08:41\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 53217**]\n",
