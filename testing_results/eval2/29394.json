The patient was a restrained driver who\nlost control of his vehicle with the result that the vehicle\nstruck a tree. The patient required quite a lengthy\nextrication and was without a definitive airway for an\nundetermined period of time. The patient was transferred from\nthe referring facility to the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 2142**]\n[**Last Name (Titles) **] by [**Location (un) 86**] [**Location (un) **]. Upon arrival, the patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma score of 3. The initial findings were\nessentially [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma score of 3.\n\nAfter initial stabilization, workup consisted of imaging of\nthe head, cervical spine and chest. The chest x-ray revealed\na diffuse whiteout of the left chest compatible with both\nhemorrhage and contusion. A left tube thoracostomy had been\naccomplished. The CT scan revealed diffuse loss of great\nwhite matter, differentiation loss of the sulci secondary to\na combination of head injury and diffuse anoxic injury. There\nwas a right to left shift of approximately 1 cm at the level\nof septum pellucidum and the suprasellar cisterns were nearly\ncompletely effaced. The findings were most consistent with\nacute anoxic injury superimposed on intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the trauma ICU\nin consultation with the neurosurgery service. An\nintracranial monitor was placed and high ICP pressures were\ninitially encountered. The family was informed by both the\nneurosurgery service and trauma service of the critical\nnature of the head injury that it would likely preclude\nsurvival. The patient was aggressively resuscitated and all\nattempts were made to maintain an acceptable cerebral\nperfusion pressure. All these efforts were to no avail. The\npatient subsequently began having excessive hemorrhage out of\nhis left tube thoracostomy. Because of the future nature of\nthe injury, no additional resuscitation efforts were\nentertained. The patient subsequently expired.\n\n\n\n                        [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 449**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 67333**]\nMEDQUIST36\nD:  [**2136-5-5**] 10:14:36\nT:  [**2136-5-5**] 15:27:07\nJob#:  [**Job Number 70590**]\n",
