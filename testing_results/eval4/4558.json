    "note_text": "Admission Date:  [**2113-11-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-11-9**]\n\n\nService:  ACOVE\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male\nstatus post TVR and MVR with prolonged intubation\npostoperatively back in [**Month (only) **], rapid atrial fibrillation,\nhistory of loculated right-sided effusion (status post\ndecortication), history of Methicillin resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus pneumonia, history of right\ndiaphragmatic history and history of colon cancer and history\nof prostate cancer who re-presents from [**Hospital 1319**] Hospital\nwith worsening shortness of breath, which has been\nnonresponsive to Lasix and nebulizers.\n\nAs per his daughter, the patient was doing fairly well until\na few days prior to admission when he developed somnolence\naround the time of his elective bronchoscopy.  A BAL culture\nfrom [**10-31**] was positive for moderate normal flora with\nmoderate growth Serratia marcescens of two species, both\nsensitive to bactrim.  The patient was subsequently started\non Bactrim, however, continued to develop increased\nsomnolence and occasional episodes of nausea and vomiting.\nDuring this time, the patient also had >....<of his trachea\n(date of which is unclear, but as per patient, was\napproximately four days prior to admission).  He subsequently\ndeveloped worsening shortness of breath and increased 02\nrequirement.  He was noted to have a hematocrit drop to 25\nand was transfused two units of packed red blood cells in\nhopes of relieving the patient's dyspnea.  The patient was\nalso given Lasix between transfusions.  It was unclear\nwhether the patient was adequately diuresed or not.\n\nOn the date of admission, the patient was reportedly on five\nliters of nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 90%.  An\narterial blood gas done at the time was 7.36/63.8/72.  The\npatient was given additional Lasix and nebulizers without\nimprovement of dyspnea.  The patient complained of increasing\northopnea, shortness of breath, cough productive of yellow\nsputum and an inability to clear his secretions.  The patient\ndenies fevers, chills, no chest pain, no abdominal pain, no\nrashes, no pruritus.  The patient does complain of \"swelling\nof his right leg\" and states that in the past, this leg has\nswelled larger than the left leg.   He does not why there is\na difference.\n\nIn the Emergency Department, the patient was given 60 mg of\nSolu-Medrol and 1 gram of Ceftriaxone.  The patient was\ntransferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was\nclosely monitored, restarted on digoxin and Lopressor for\nrapid atrial fibrillation and given frequent chest Physical\nTherapy, incentive spirometry and suctioning.  He was tried\non nasal CPAP, but did not tolerate this at night.  The\npatient was also volume resuscitated with intravenous fluids\nand given no steroids as there was no evidence of chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.\n\nHis past hospitalization from [**2113-7-13**] to [**2113-9-6**], the patient was admitted for the elected TVR and MVR\nwith a prolonged postoperative course including rapid atrial\nfibrillation, volume overload, right-sided loculated\neffusion, possible Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus\naureus pneumonia and an inability to wean from the vent.  The\npatient had trachea and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy\nplaced.  A VATS procedure was done for right-sided effusion\nand atelectasis as per operative note, which showed blood\nclot, which was removed.  A decortication was done and\nre-expansion of right lower lobe was observed.  No tissue was\nsent for pathology and the patient was sent to [**Hospital1 1319**] for a\nvent wean.  From [**2113-9-10**] to [**2113-9-14**], the\npatient was re-admitted from [**Hospital1 1319**] to [**Hospital6 1760**] due to increased sputum\nproductive, low grade fever, increasing vent support.  Sputum\ngrew out Serratia and the patient was given Levaquin and\nCeftazidime.\n\nOn admission, the patient was noted to have a cuff leak which\nwas repaired and bronchoscopy revealed minimal secretions.\nVancomycin, Ceftriaxone were discontinued since Serratia was\nsensitive to Levaquin.  Serratia was thought at that time to\nhave some element of seizure after he was diuresed, however,\nan echocardiogram done showed a normal ejection fraction.\nThe patient was started on Captopril, Lasix and digoxin with\nimprovement of bilateral effusions.  It was thought he may\nhave had Dressler's syndrome and steroid was added to his\nregimen at that time.  The patient continued progressive vent\nwean and went back to [**Hospital1 1319**].\n\nFrom [**10-3**] to [**10-13**] at [**Hospital1 1319**], the patient\ncontinued the vent wean and on [**10-2**], the patient felt\nrapid atrial fibrillation.  His Captopril was decreased and\nbeta-blocker was added with minimal response.  An\nelectrocardiogram was concerning for ST depressions in the\nanterior lateral leads and the patient was transferred back\nto [**Hospital6 256**].\n\nThe patient was given intravenous Lopressor which decreased\nthe rate in the Emergency Department, but resulted in low\nblood pressure, which responded to intravenous fluid boluses.\nChest x-ray at that time revealed new right upper lobe\ninfiltrate.  The patient's heart rate was controlled with\nbeta-blockers, however, the patient continued to have\nintermittent hypertension, in which he was given IV fluid.\nThe patient completed a course of vancomycin and Zosyn for\npneumonia with suspected Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus\naureus or other resistant organisms.  Psychiatric was\nconsulted for anxiety at that time and the patient was\nstarted on Zyprexa which decreased his vent dependence.  The\npatient was finally discontinued from the vent and maintained\non trachea mask.\n\nThe [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also notable for worsening\ndrainage of wound from his VAT site and the patient was\nevaluated by Plastic Surgery who recommended conservative\ntreatment.  The patient was sent back to [**Hospital1 1319**].\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery\nbypass graft in [**2097**] with left main disease.\n2.  Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.\n3.  Prostate cancer, status post prostatectomy in [**2098**],\nstatus post penile implant.\n4.  Colon cancer, status post colectomy in [**2107**].\n5.  Pancytopenia thought to be due to MDS, however, bone\nmarrow biopsy in [**2113-7-13**] was nondiagnostic.\n6.  HIT antibody positive in [**2113-8-13**].\n7.  Status post ureteral stent and urostomy.\n8.  MVR/TVR in [**2113-7-13**] with hospital course as above.\n9.  Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n10. Echocardiogram in [**2113-9-12**], ejection fraction 50-55%,\npositive TR, moderate PA systolic hypertension, prosthetic\nmitral valve seen.\n11. Catheterization on [**2113-7-11**]:  100% occlusion of the\nleft main coronary artery, patent left internal mammary\nartery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to\nleft circumflex, patent right coronary artery stent, severe\nmitral regurgitation and moderate diastolic ventricular\ndysfunction, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension\n(pressure 45/26).\n\nALLERGIES:  Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, antibody\npositive.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:\n1.  Captopril 6.25 mg po t.i.d.\n2.  Zyprexa 5 mg po q.h.s., 2.5 mg po q.a.m.\n3.  Lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d.\n4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d.\n5.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.\n6.  Prozac 40 mg po q.d.\n7.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d.\n8.  Bactrim DS 1 tablet b.i.d. to complete a course on\n[**11-9**].\n9.  Coumadin.\n10. Promote with fiber.\n11. Phenergan 25 mg intravenously q.6 hour prn.\n12. Ativan .5 mg po q.h.s.\n13. Simethicone 80 mg po q.i.d.\n14. Guaifenesin 300 mg po q.i.d.\n15. Ocean nasal spray.\n16. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.\n17. Salmeterol 1 puff b.i.d.\n18. Fluticasone 220 mcg 2 puffs b.i.d.\n19. Ceftriaxone 1 gram q.d.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Father with myocardial infarction at age 59,\nmother with breast cancer.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone at home before surgery in [**2113-7-13**].  Since then has been at [**Hospital1 1319**].  Smoked four packs\nper day times 37 years, quit 35 years ago, occasional ETOH.\n\nLABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 7.0, hematocrit barely\nstable at 30, no pandemia on discharge.  Creatinine 1.1.  INR\n1.7 on [**11-8**], ALT 27, AST 29, alkaline phosphatase 112,\namylase 54, total bilirubin 0.2.  CK 28, sputum culture\ncontaminated.  Blood cultures no growth to date.  Urine\nculture revealed enterococcus.  Chest x-ray showed\nprogressive loss of right lung volume which may represent a\ncombination collapse and increasing pleural effusion.  Lipase\n25 and 60.  Electrocardiogram:  Atrial fibrillation, [**Street Address(2) 4793**]\ndepressions in V4 through V6 old and an Q in V1.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.7.  Heart rate 130.\nBlood pressure 100/72.  Oxygen saturation 96% on 60% high\nflow, however, on discharge, at 96% on two liters and 88% on\nroom air.  In general, the patient is an elderly male, awake\nand alert in no acute distress, but is very hard of hearing.\nHead, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No gag reflex elicited.\nExtraocular movements intact.  Pupils equal, round and\nreactive to light.  No lymphadenopathy.  Stoma from trachea\nis healed over.  Oropharynx clear.  Mucous membranes moist.\nHeart:  Irregularly irregular, positive systolic murmur at\nthe apex, normal S1, S2, no gallops heard.  Lungs:  No breath\nsounds at right base, clear to auscultation bilaterally\notherwise.  Extremities:  Warm, trace edema, 2+ dorsalis\npedis pulses bilaterally.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred out of the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit on [**2113-11-6**] and his\nhypoxia resolved rather quickly with nebulizers, chest\nPhysical Therapy and incentive spirometry and some gentle\ndiuresis.  There was a question as to whether the shortness\nof breath was a combination of mucous plugging plus right\nhemidiaphragmatic injury, as well as a question of mild\ncongestive heart failure.  The patient also was continued on\na ten day course of Ceftriaxone and did well with this.  It\nwas elected not to start Solu-Medrol as the patient had no\nevidence of acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nflare.\n\nFor his atrial fibrillation, the patient was continued on\nLopressor and digoxin, as well as Coumadin.  The patient's\nhematocrit of 25 at the outside hospital, did not seem to be\nan acute decline.  The patient's stool was OB positive,\nhowever, after blood transfusion, the patient responded well\nand the hematocrit remained stable.  The patient may in the\nfuture need a colonoscopy for work-up.  As far as the\npatient's anxiety, the wife was concerned that the patient's\nZyprexa may be causing him to be somewhat tired and lethargic\nduring the day and since the patient had never been on\nZyprexa prior to the vent wean, it was thought reasonable to\ngo ahead and wean his Zyprexa to off.  The patient's Zyprexa\ndose was decreased to 2.5 mg b.i.d. on discharge.\n\nThe patient did well throughout his hospital stay.  He did\nwell at clearing his own secretions with suctioning himself,\nas well as doing his incentive spirometry and he was able to\nbe out of bed into a chair with help from the physical\ntherapist.  The patient will need further Physical Therapy,\nas well as to complete six more days of a Ceftriaxone course\nand his Coumadin will also have to be more therapeutic in\nlight of his atrial fibrillation, as well as his MVR and TVR.\n\nPatient was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] hospital in\ngood condition to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19395**].\n\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\n1.
