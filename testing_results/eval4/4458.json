A patient timeout was performed by two patient\nidentifiers. Access to the right common femoral artery was\nobtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local\nanesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and\nwith aseptic precautions. Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 7648**]\nwire was introduced and the needle taken out. Over the wire, a 5\nFrench vascular sheath was placed and connected to saline\ninfusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with\na continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 French Berenstein\ncatheter was introduced and connected to continuous saline\ninfusion (with heparin mixture: 1000 units of heparin in 1000 cc\nof saline). The following vessels were selectively catheterized\nand arteriograms were performed from these locations. After\nreview of films the catheter and the sheath were withdrawn and\npressure was applied on the groin until hemostasis was obtained.\nThe procedure was uneventful and the patient tolerated the\nprocedure well without complications. The patient was sent to\nthe floor with orders.\n\nThe following blood vessels were selectively catheterized and\narteriograms were obtained in the AP and lateral projections.\n\n1. Right internal carotid artery.\n2. Left internal carotid artery.\n3. Right common carotid artery.\n4. Left common carotid artery.\n5. Right vertebral artery.\n6. Left vertebral artery.\n\nThe left posterior communicating artery appears prominent. The\nleft vertebral artery is seen supplying the anterior spinal\nartery. There is no evidence of any aneurysms, AV fistulas, AV\nformations, stenosis or occlusions.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\nCerebral angiogram of the above-mentioned vessels demonstrated\nno evidence of any aneurysm, vascular malformation, stenosis or\nocclusion.\n\nThe attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was scrubbed and present for the entire\nprocedure.\n\nDR.

Pt underwent Angiogram which\nwas negative for aneurysm.  He was started on Nimodipine. Stroke\nconsult was obtained for intial syncope workup. He was placed on\nmeclizine for continued complaints of vertigo.  He was\ntransferred to a regular floor and evaluated by the ENT team for\nthe c/o vertigo.  They performed Epley Maneuver from which the\npt has relief of symptoms.  They diagnosed him with benign\npositional vertigo.  He was seen by PT and deemed safe for\ndischarge with a home safety eval.  His dilantin and nimodipine\nwere stopped as he has never had a sz during this stay nor is\nhis SAH thought to be aneurysmal.  he was d/c'd to home without\npain medication per his request.  Follow up and instructions\nwere discussed.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications prior to admission:\nAtripla\nCrestor\nLipitor\nLisinopril\nInsulin\nASA - last dose was one week ago - stopped it because he has a\nplanned surgery for hernia repair soon.\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
