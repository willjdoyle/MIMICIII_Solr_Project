Symptoms\npersisted for one hour without improvement and EMS was called.\n.\nHistory was obtained from son [**Name (NI) 3065**] as patient was intubated\nand sedated at time of arrival. Patient has no prior history of\nstroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,\nbleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,\nhemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She has not had any\nrecent fevers, chills or rigors, exertional buttock or calf\npain. All of the other review of systems were negative.\n.\nCardiac review of systems is notable only for the presence of\ndyspnea at rest. ROS is negative for any report of chest pain,\nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,\npalpitations, syncope or presyncope.\nIn the ED, patient was intubated emergently and code STEMI was\ncalled.

A nitro\ndrip was initiated which resulted in hypotension.

Worsening of pulmonary edema.\n.\n[**2111-10-15**] ECHO:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and\nregional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of\naortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve\nleaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical\naortic valve stenosis (area <0.5 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic\nregurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.\n[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation\nmay be significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery\nsystolic pressure could not be determined. There is a small\npericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.\n\nIMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Symmetric LVH with\nglobal/regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral\nregurgitation.\n.\nUNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2111-10-15**] 6:12 AM\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Known lastname 19198**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman who presented to the ER with\ncomplaints of acute onset shortness of breath. An EKG performed\nat that time revealed ST elevations in V1 and V2, reciprocal ST\ndepressions in I and AvL, and a code STEMI was called. The\npatient was emergently intubated in the ED for respiratory\ndistress from pulmonary edema secondary to her MI. After\ndiscussion, it was felt that she was not a candidate for cardiac\ncatheterization, and she was admitted to the CCU for further\nmanagement.\n.\nIn the CCU,  EKG changes resolved with medical management\nincluding ASA, Plavix, Lipitor, and heparin gtt. The patient did\nnot tolerate nitro gtt [**2-13**] hypotension. She was initially put on\nperipheral dopamine for hemodynamic support, maintaining\nSBP's>90, until it was revealed the she was DNR/DNI. At that\ntime, an extensive family discussion ensued, and it was decided\nto wean the patient off of pressors and extubate her.\n.\nAn echocardiogram was performed which revealed critical Aortic\nStenosis. Again, it was felt that the patient's condition was\ntoo tenuous for valvuloplasty or operative repair. At this\npoint, per discussion with the family, the patient's goals of\ncare were changed to comfort measures. She was transferred to\nthe floor and her comfort was maintained with a morphine drip\nand prn ativan.\n.\nOn [**10-18**] the patient was noted to exhibit [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]/agonal\nrespirations had ceased. Family was at the bedside. PE revelaed\nfixed and dilated puils, no carotid pulse, no withdrawal to\npain, and absence of cardiac sounds. Time of death pronounced at\n8:55PM. Family declined an autopsy.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1) Synthroid 75 mcg daily\n2) Actonel 35 mg qweek\n3) Salsalate 750 mg [**Hospital1 **]\n4) Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 **] (day 4)\n\nDischarge Medications:\nn/a\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nST elevation myocardial infarction [**2-13**] Aortic stenosis\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nexpired\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nn/a\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nn/a\n\n\n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2908**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 2909**]\n\n",
