He had a prolonged hospital course\non the trauma SICU service, and then the trauma surgery\nservice on the floor that has been detailed in the previous\ndischarge summary.  Briefly, his course is notable for\nintubation, status post resuscitation, and anoxic brain\ninjury with injury to the bilateral lentiform nuclei.  He\nreceived a tracheostomy and a percutaneous endoscopic\ngastrostomy tube for feeding on [**2114-2-26**].\n\nHe was transferred to the neurology service on [**2114-4-16**]\nfor further care.  He was consulted by the trauma surgery\nservice for anoxic brain injury, and it was decided that he\nshould be transferred to the neurology service for further\ncare.  He had been noted to be very agitated and was started\non Seroquel, as well as Zoloft.  He has now been transferred\nto the neurology floor for better control of these movements\nand for disposition to a skilled nursing facility.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Depression.\n\nMEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER:  1) clonazepam 1 mg po bid, 2)\nSeroquel 50 mg po bid, 3) Zoloft 75 mg po qd, 4) bacitracin\nointment 1 application TP [**Hospital1 **], 5) baclofen 10 mg po tid, 6)\nbisacodyl 10 mg PR qd, 7) valproic acid 1 gm NG q 12 h, 8)\ntrazodone 100 mg po q hs prn, 9) labetalol 200 mg po tid, 10)\nacetaminophen 325-650 mg po q 4-6 h prn, 11) artificial tears\n1-2 drops OU q 3-6 h prn, 12) heparin 5,000 U subcu q 12 h.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Previously in jail for armed robbery, has\nfive children, mother is in close contact.\n\nEXAM UPON PRESENTATION:  Generally:  Cachectic male with eyes\nopen, laying in bed at 30?????? angle, constantly moving.  HEENT:\nReveals moist mucous membranes with trach collar without\npurulent secretions.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation\nbilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm\nwithout murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, flat,\n[**Last Name (LF) 6416**], [**First Name3 (LF) 282**] tube in place without pus or ooze.\nExtremities:  No edema or ulcers of the lower extremities.\nNeuro - Mental Status:  Eyes open, sticks out tongue, and\ncloses eyes to command, squeezes fingers and wiggles toes to\ncommand occasionally.  He does not have any verbal output.\nCranial nerves:  Extraocular movements appear grossly intact,\npupils equally round and reactive from 5 to 4 mm bilaterally,\nno facial asymmetry, tongue appears midline.  Motor:\nIncreased tone in all four extremities with slight hypertonia\nin the right upper extremity compared to the left.  He is\nconstantly moving with choreoathetoid movements, more so in\nboth upper extremities, with some movements noted in the jaw.\nHis reflexes are brisk and symmetric throughout, biceps,\nbrachioradialis and patella.  The sensory and gait exam were\nnot tested.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS - 1) AGITATION:  His agitation\nwas thought to be choreoathetoid movements.  He had been on\nDilantin for a question of seizures upon admission to the\ntrauma SICU and this was eventually changed to depakote at\nthe end of [**Month (only) 116**] upon admission to the neurology service for\nthe possibility that they may mitigate his choreoathetoid\nmovements.  He was continually agitated and required hand\nrestraints to prevent him from approaching his tracheostomy\nand [**Month (only) 282**] tube for accidental removal.  He had an episode on\n[**5-28**] in which he had hypoxia by pulse oximetry, as well as\nbradycardia by oximetry.  He was attempted to be ventilated\nwith Ambu bag without much response in his O2 saturation.  He\nwas briefly admitted to the unit for closer respiratory\nmonitoring, but he was felt to be back to baseline O2\nsaturation and heart rate.  There was a question of whether\nhe had seizure activity during these episodes, as he did\nappear very agitated and moving all four extremities\nstrenuously with what appeared to be episodes of dysregulated\nbreathing.  He was given parenteral ativan, and his movements\ncalmed down, and his vital signs returned to [**Location 213**].  He was\ntransferred back to the neurology floor the same day, on [**5-28**], after he was monitored for a few hours in the unit, and he\nhad no further episodes that day.\n\nSubsequently, in the two weeks after that brief ICU transfer,\nhe did have further episodes of bradycardia and hypoxia by\npulse oximetry, but this time these were verified by\nauscultation and arterial blood gases which always showed no\nevidence of bradycardia or hypoxia by blood gas.  These were\nthought to be due partly to malfunctioning oximetry probe\nbecause of his body habitus, as well as some dysregulated\nbreathing thought to be related to his dyskinetic movements\nin the limbs and the respiratory muscles.\n\nTo simplify his medication regimen for agitation, he was\nslowly tapered off Zoloft which had a slightly activating\naffect theoretically.  He was also changed over from depakote\nback to Dilantin due to the question of seizure, and he was\nloaded quickly with Dilantin on [**5-28**] and continued on\nmaintenance doses of Dilantin throughout his hospital course.\nHe also had Haldol added-on prn for agitation and eventually,\nby the middle of [**Month (only) 205**], he was started on Haldol standing and\nincreased to 3 mg NG tid for control of choreoathetoid\nmovement.  He seemed to tolerate this medication well and was\nnoted to have fewer spontaneous movements of his upper\nextremities.  He was discontinued off his restraints on [**2114-6-13**].  He now apparently is having fewer movements\nwithout any sedation from the Haldol.\n\n2) SEIZURES:  It was never clear that the patient had a\nseizure disorder even despite his brain injury.  He had\nroutine EEGs done but there was never any evidence of\nepileptiform discharges.  Episodes during which he would\nbecome extremely agitated, but subsided with benzodiazepines\nwere not clearly related to seizure activity.  Nevertheless,\nhe remains on Dilantin for a question of a seizure disorder.\nIt should also be noted that the Dilantin may potentially\nworsen his choreoathetoid movements, but at this time they\nare being adequately controlled with the Haldol tid.\n\n3) SECRETIONS:  The patient's tracheostomy tube was inserted\nby Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the surgery service when the patient was\non the trauma surgery service.  He is at chronic risk for\naspiration, and the tracheostomy has been accessed for\nallowing for suctioning of the secretions.  On [**6-6**], Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] came by to change the patient's trach tube to a #6\nShiley fenestrated trach tube.  He was tried on multiple\ncapping trials, but the patient did not tolerate these well,\nhaving transient episodes of hypoxia after the tube was\ncapped.\n\nENT was consulted for the possibility of supraglottic\nstenosis, and they recommended a trial of steroids after\nvisualizing supraglottic stenosis on laryngoscopy.  The\npatient tolerated the steroids well and actually had\ndecreased edema by repeat laryngoscopy.  The capping trial\nwas tried again, but the patient continued to have multiple\nsecretions, for which a tracheostomy tube was deemed to be\nhelpful for long-term future for suctioning these secretions.\nTherefore, the fenestrated #6 Shiley tracheostomy was left-in\nand should probably remain in indefinitely.  He also has had\nsputum culture and Gram stain on [**5-21**] which grew out\nPseudomonas, and this was thought likely to be colonization,\nas the patient has been afebrile, and there has been no\npurulent sputum.\n\n4) TOOTH BLEEDING:  During the second week of [**Month (only) 205**], the\npatient did have an episode of bleeding from the mouth.  This\nwas investigated with a Yankauer suction tube, and it was\nthought that the patient's teeth were loose causing him to\nbleed slightly.  The bleeding was never major and lost only\nmaybe 1 or 2 cc at the most.  His bleeding resolved on its\nown with two incisor teeth slightly loose, but never caused\nany further problems, or never appeared as if they were\ninfected.\n\nOral surgery briefly saw the patient informally on [**6-14**]\nand felt that a general dentistry consult was necessary.\nThat dentistry consult is pending depending on whether the\npatient is able to leave to rehab where he can get outpatient\ndental care.\n\n5) NUTRITION:  The patient has been on tube feeds ever since\nthe [**Month (only) 282**] tube was placed in [**Month (only) 547**].  His last recorded weight\nin [**Month (only) **] was 55 kg, and his last weight on [**6-13**] is 93\npounds.  Nutrition has been closely following him, and he has\nbeen changed on his tube feeds now to 80 cc/h on a new\nformula, and he will, from now on, get biweekly weights, so\nthat he can be monitored for weight loss.  The choreoathetoid\nmovements were thought to cause increased energy expenditure.\n\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1112**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 7499**]\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 4064**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2114-6-15**]  15:47\nT:  [**2114-6-20**]  10:13\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 18156**]\n",
