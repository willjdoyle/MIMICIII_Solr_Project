    "note_text": "Admission Date:  [**2114-2-11**]     Discharge Date:\n\nDate of Birth:   [**2079-2-4**]     Sex:  M\n\nService:  TRAUMA SURGERY\n\nThe patient is being transferred to Neurology service.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 35 year old male who\nwas initially brought to the Trauma Service by the [**Location (un) 86**]\npolice.  He was found hanging in his jail cell by a telephone\ncord with estimated time of not breathing for ten minutes.\nApparently he stepped off a stool.  Initially on evaluation,\nhe was unresponsive and asystolic.  CPR was initiated at the\nscene which resulted in regained pulses.  On transfer, it was\nnoted that he is breathing spontaneously.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Depression.\n\nALLERGIES:  Unclear.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\n1.  Zyprexa.\n2.  Ativan.\n3.  Paxil.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He formerly worked in construction.  Unknown\ntobacco history and unknown alcohol history.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In trauma, he was unresponsive and\nintubated.  The heart rate is 119, blood pressure is 221/140,\nand he is intubated with oxygen saturation at 100%.  In\ngeneral, he is sedated, intubated.  The pupils are equal,\nround, and reactive to light.  He does not open his eyes.\nTrachea was in the midline.  The chest was clear to\nauscultation bilaterally.  The heart has a regular rate and\nrhythm with normal heart sounds without extra heart sounds.\nThe abdomen was soft and nondistended and no surgical scars.\nThe back has no step-off.  Rectal tone is normal and guaiac\nnegative.  The extremities were warm without obvious\ndeformities.  Neurologically, he is unresponsive, breathing\nspontaneously.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was\n7.1, hematocrit 45.0 and platelet count 269,000.  Sodium 138,\npotassium 4.6, chloride 103, bicarbonate 20, blood urea\nnitrogen 17, creatinine 1.0.  His sugar level is 150 and his\ncoagulation studies were prothrombin time 12.8, partial\nthromboplastin time 25.8 and INR 1.1.  Arterial blood gas was\nobtained which showed a pH 7.33, pCO2 39. and pO2 174.\nToxicology screen was obtained which showed positive for\nbenzodiazepines.\n\nThe patient then subsequently received intubation and\ntransferred to the Trauma Surgery Intensive Care Unit for\nIntensive care.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient essentially was staying in the\nTrauma Surgery Intensive Care Unit from the day of admission\non [**2114-2-11**], during which a neurology consultation was\nobtained and he was evaluated with several\nelectroencephalograms.  He was also evaluated by a brain\nmagnetic resonance scan on [**2114-2-13**], and then he is put on\ntracheostomy and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube\nwas placed on [**2114-2-26**].  He remained CPAP and feeding tube.\nHe is transferred on the 11th to the floor in stable\ncondition.  Subsequently, he is transferred to the Neurology\nservice on [**2114-4-11**].\n\nThe following is a system by system review of a brief\nhospital course at the time of this dictation:\n1.  Neurology - The patient upon admission to Intensive Care\nUnit, Neurology service was consulted for unresponsiveness\nand to evaluate possible brain ischemia.\nElectroencephalogram was performed on [**2114-2-12**], which is\ngrossly abnormal and consistent with widespread cortical\ndysfunction consistent with moderate encephalopathy.  This\nwas repeated [**2114-3-15**], which again showed mild widespread\ncortical dysfunction.  Again, electroencephalogram is\nrepeated on [**2114-3-23**], which essentially showed no significant\nimprovement.  On physical examination neurologically, he was\ninitially unresponsive and on [**2114-2-18**], he was noted to be\nspontaneously opening eyes and looked around but there was\nposturing.  He was noted to have conjugated gaze at around\n[**2114-3-22**], with the pupils equal and reactive to light and\nincreased tone in all four extremities and clonus in the\nankles bilaterally.  During [**Month (only) 547**], he had episodes of tongue\nbiting which responded to Ativan.  During the hospital stay,\nhe was put on Dilantin and was dosed accordingly.  On\n[**2114-2-28**], it was noted question of seizure activity and over\nthe last month he is getting more and more responsive, now is\noccasionally tracking people with gazing and seems to be able\nto recognize family members and there is maybe occasions even\nnodding yes and no for the last ten days or so.  However, he\ndoes get very agitated and severely diaphoretic and was\ntrained to getting out of bed.  This was eventually treated\nwith Seroquel and Ativan and also was with restrictions.\nCurrently on the day of transfer, he is started with around\nthe clock Ativan and Seroquel.  Upon the suggestions of\nNeurology service, we have been trying to decrease the Ativan\ndose to p.r.n. and to continue Seroquel with possible\nincreased dose to decrease his level of agitation.  In late\n[**Month (only) 116**], the patient seems to be having slight improvement in\nneurological examinations and he is waiting for neurologic\nrehabilitation placement partially for Medicaid approval and\nit was decided that he is going to be benefited by being\ntransferred to Neurology service the end of [**Month (only) 116**].\n\n2.  Respiratory - The patient has been intubated upon arrival\nand was initially on SIMV for one day and then switched to\nCPAP with pressure support subsequently.  He tolerated these\nsettings but there may be evidence of aspiration at the\nbeginning of his admission.  Sputum culture was consistent\nwith a respiratory tract infection, possible pneumonia, so on\n[**2114-2-19**], he was started to be treated with Levaquin and\nsubsequently because blood culture grew out gram negative\nrods on [**2114-2-22**], Vancomycin was started and then Gentamicin\nwas started two days later.  A tracheostomy tube was placed\naround [**2114-2-26**], and he is being seen by the respiratory care\nservice subsequently.\n\n3.  Cardiovascular - The patient when initially presented had\nepisodes of hypertension. Therefore, he was put on Labetalol\nfor blood pressure control.  During the hospitalization,\nthere is no issue of any cardiovascular distress.  Pulse rate\nis consistently in the 80s to 90s and blood pressure has been\naround 150s.\n\n4.  Gastrointestinal - The patient was started on tube feeds\n[**2114-2-16**], and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was\nplaced on [**2114-2-26**].  His tube feeds were gradually increased\nwith ProMod with Fiber in late [**Month (only) 116**] before transferring.  He\nis tolerating tube feeds at 140 cc/hour.  Otherwise, he is on\ngastrointestinal prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors and\nthere are no other gastrointestinal issues.\n\n5.  Endocrine - He has been checked with fingerstick and\ncovered appropriately with insulin sliding scale.  There is\nno other endocrine issues.\n\n6.  Renal - The patient has been on occasions observed to\nhave increased urine output which responded appropriately\nwith fluid bolus.  His blood urea nitrogen and creatinine\nremained normal at approximately 0.6 on the day of transfer\n[**2114-4-10**].  He has been found to have urinary tract infection\non [**2114-4-10**], and subsequently he was put on Levaquin.\n\n7.  Infectious disease - As indicated above, the patient\ninitially showed symptoms of aspiration pneumonia.  Chest\nx-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation which occurred\naround late [**Month (only) 958**]. The patient was on Levaquin, Vancomycin\nand Gentamicin until this was discontinued [**2114-3-2**].\nSubsequently, the patient had episode of urinary tract\ninfection with approximately 50 white blood cells per high\npower field on urinalysis.  So, he is started on Levaquin\naround [**2114-4-9**].  On the day of transfer, he is still\nreceiving the Levaquin.\n\n8.  Disposition - Apparently, in early times of admission, a\nfamily meeting was held and it was decided to keep the\npatient in full code.  The patient has been actively screened\nfor neurological rehabilitation facility which is also\npending Medicaid approval.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  This patient is to be transferred to\nNeurology service around [**2114-4-11**].\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Central nervous system hypoxia\nsecondary to hanging.\n\n\n\n\n                          [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 18153**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 18154**]\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 6276**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2114-4-11**]  11:03\nT:  [**2114-4-14**]  11:52\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 18155**]\n",
