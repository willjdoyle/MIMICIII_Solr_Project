Patient has\nchronic abdominal pain, usually occuring after meals, thought to\nbe an anginal equivalent - often responding to SL nitro. She is\nreported to have suddenly grabbed the RLQ of her abdomen\nlastnight complaining of pain. She later had an episode of\n\"coffee-ground\" emesis that was reportedly gastrocult negative.\nHer ostomy output has not been melanic or with gross blood. She\ndenies chest pain, shortness of breath, increased ostomy output,\ndysuria or hematuria. She was brought in to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER for\nfurther evaluation.\n.\nIn the ED, vitals were T - 99.6, HR - 90, BP - 138/82, RR - 24,\nO2 - 94% (unclear if on room air). She later spiked to 103.6 and\nwas increased to 4 liters O2 with 96% saturation. Blood cultures\nand UA/UCx were drawn with UA strongly positive for UTI. CXR\nalso showed perihilar opacities concerning for PNA and patient\nwas empirically started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl. The\nabdominal pain was evaluated with a CT abdomen, which was\ninitially concerning for an obstruction as minimal contrast was\nseen at the patient's colostomy. A subsequent KUB then showed\nsufficient contrast through to the colostomy site, which along\nwith an unremarkable surgical evaluation was ressuring for the\nabsence of a bowel obstruction. EKG showed new STD in the\nlateral leads and patient was given ASA. Her blood pressure was\ntenuous so she was not given a beta-blocker. CEs were sent off\nand the patient was admitted to medicine for further work-up.\nROS: Only remarkable for that mentioned above. Per report from\n[**Hospital3 2558**] nurse, patient received her influenza vaccine on\n[**2110-11-6**] and her Pneumovax on [**2108-11-1**].\n.\n\n   On admission to the ICU after being in the ED for 22 hours,\nshe was feeling well with no real complaints. She did note that\nher abdomen was mildly tender diffusely with palpation, but\ndenied dizziness, cp, sob, nausea, vomiting. Her initial vs on\nadmission to the ICU were, T 97, BP 142/52, R 18, O2 95% 4 L NC,\nHR 72.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.  PUD s/p Billroth 2, about 50y ago, recently s/p revision and\nconversion to Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy with placement of\njejunal feeding tube [**1-3**] due to bleeding marginal ulcer at\nanastomotic site\n2.  CAD s/p CABG [**2098**] SVG -> RCA, SVG -> LAD, SVG -> LCx, cath\n[**8-3**] confirmed patent grafts\n3.  perforated bowel secondary to fecal impaction s/p subtotal\ncolectomy c ostomy [**2099**]\n4.  paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\n5.  hypertension\n6.  CHF, last echo [**2108-1-27**] EF 30-40%\n7.

Patient states that she used to smoke\nmore. She was born in [**Location (un) 86**] and has been a life-[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 86**]\nresdident. She lives currently at [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 583**],\nMA. Prior to that she lived alone and was independent. Her\nhusband passed away several years ago. She has 3 daughters who\nare all in her 60s. She has 3 grandsons, 1 great-grandson, and 1\n\ngreat-granddaughter. [**Name (NI) **] health care proxy is her daughter,\n[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 6955**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 18144**]).\n\n\nFamily History:\nBoth parents passed away, unknown cause per patient. Denies\nfamily h/p CAD, MI, cancer, CVA, DM.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nPE on MICU admission:\nVitals:  T 97, BP 142/52, R 18, O2 sat 95% 4L NC, HR 72\nGeneral: Awake, alert, oriented x 3, pleasant, NAD\nHEENT: NC/AT; PERRLA; OP clear with dry mucous membranes\nNeck: Supple, no LAD, no JVD\nChest/CV: S1, S2 nl, no m/r/g appreciated\nLungs: CTAB\nAbd: Soft, diffusely tender to palpation, + BS, ostomy in place,\nwell-appearing, draining green stool that is guaiac positive\nExt: No c/c/e\nNeuro: Grossly intact\nSkin: No lesions\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nEKG: sinus, nl intervals, prolonged PR, narrow QRS, TWI in V4-V6\n(new compared to prior)\n.\nLabs: (see below)\n.\nImaging:\nCXR ([**1-22**]): Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.\nThere\nis stable borderline cardiomegaly. The thoracic aorta is\ncalcified and tortuous. There are new perihilar patchy airspace\nopacities concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. No\npneumothorax or sizable pleural effusion. Osseous structures are\ngrossly unremarkable.\n\nIMPRESSION: Perihilar airspace disease with air bronchograms\nconcerning for aspiration or pneumonia.\n.\nCT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**1-23**]):\n1. Perihilar and left basilar airspace consolidation concerning\nfor\naspiration or pneumonia.\n2. Mild gaseous distention of the afferent limb of the Roux-en-Y\nwith enteric contrast seen within the efferent limb extending to\nthe left pelvis with more distal collapsed loops of distal ileum\nextending to the right ileostomy. Some enteric contrast does\nappear to extend to the ostomy site. It is unclear if the\nfindings are secondary to the relatively short oral prep time or\nrepresent\na very early small-bowel obstruction. Continued surveillance is\nrecommended.\n3. Stable cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas.\n4. Unchanged severe compression deformity of the L2 vertebral\nbody.\n5. Dense calcification throughout the intra-abdominal arterial\nvasculature.\n.\nKUB ([**1-23**]):\nA nonobstructed bowel gas pattern is evident\nwith oral contrast seen projecting over the right lower lobe\nostomy. There is a dense right renal shadow and contrast seen\nwithin both ureters from a recent CT scan. There is mild gaseous\ndistention of the stomach. The lungs demonstrate perihilar\nairspace opacities concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. The\naorta is calcified and ectatic. Again noted is a compression\nfracture of L2 with severe dextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine.\n\n\nIMPRESSION: Satisfactory bowel gas pattern with progression of\nenteric contrast through the right lower abdominal ostomy.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nA/P: [**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with PMHx of multiple abdominal surgeries,\nCAD s/p CABG, a. fib, hypothyroidism who presents with acute on\nchronic abdominal pain, found to have UTI and overall septic\npicture.\n.\n# Sepsis from UTI: Pt initially with tacchycardia and\nhypotension which resolved with fluids, and + UA. Patient did\nhave slight lactate elevation to 3.0, which resolved, and\nremained afebrile throughout stay.  Urine Cx showed\n+Pansensitive E.coli. Pt intially started on Vancomycin and\nzosyn empirically, narrowed to ceftriaxone, and then cipro for\n14 day total course.  Foley was removed before discharge.\n.\n# Abdominal Pain: Pt with chronic abdominal pain which worsened\nthe morning of [**1-24**] in the setting of suspected sepsis from UTI.\n Pain greatest in LUQ pain, but abdomen was soft and mildly\ntender. Lactate initially elevated, but resolved. Upright KUB\nshowed no free air or obstruction. Pt was transitioned to a PPI\n[**Hospital1 **] and given tylenol q6hr for pain.  C diff was negative x2,\nand pt had normal ostomy output.  Abdomininal pain improved on\nHD 3 when transfered to floor, and pt quickly advanced to full\ndiet.  Did have reoccurance of general abdominal pain, but\nreports similar to previous ab pain.  Treated with tylenol\n\n# Anemia: Pt had anemia and recieved several blood transfusions.\nSubsequent hcts have been stable\n.\n# Atrial Fibrillation: On Coumadin as an outpatient with\nsubtherapeutic INR intially. Patient's CHADS2 score is 2 (HTN,\nage; patient is reported to have had a CVA, but previous head\nimaging is unremarkable), which puts her at moderate risk of\nembolic event for which she is on Coumadin. Initially held given\ncoagulopathy and concern for GIB.  Coumadin was restarted at 1\nmg of [**1-24**] with a theraputic INR.  Concern for interaction with\nciprofloxacin, so ctm INR.  PT became tacchycardic to the 130's\nand betablockers were titrated to a HR of approximately 80.\nWill d/c pt on elevated level of BB; metoprolol XL at 175 [**Hospital1 **].\n.\n# Tacchypnea: Pt with tachypnea and bilateral basilar crackles\non exam. Perihilar opacities on CXR, but not overtly suggestive\nof pna, but with vascular congestion. PT denies cough or sputum\nproduction and remained afebrile. Pt recieved gentle diuresis\nwith lasix - approx 1 L, with resolution of tacchypnea and\nsubsequently maintained adequate O2 saturations on room air.\n.\n# CAD: S/P CABG in [**2098**] with functional grafts demonstrated on\ncath in [**2106**]. Currently denies CP, but EKG does show new TWI in\nlateral leads. Patient is on BB, ASA, statin as an outpatient.\nTransiently held beta-blockade to to hypotension, but then\nrestarted; patient continued on ASA and statin. Ruled out for MI\nwith 2 sets of ces 12 hrs apart. Last Echo was [**10-6**] and showed\nEF of 50-55%. Continued home statin, asprin and betablocker\n.\n#. HTN; Initially held antihypertensives in setting of\nhypotension, but then returned the BB in form of metoprolol.\nMetoprolol increased to titrate HR, with no adverse affect on\nBP.  Will hold amlodipine as pt has well controled BP and HR on\nmetoprolol\n.\n# ARF: Creatinine increased to 1.6, from 1.1, likely prerenal in\nthe setting of vomiting and insensible losses while febrile. CT\nabdomen did not demonstrate kidney stones or signs of\nobstruction. Urine lytes c/w prerenal process as una is < 10.\nResolved with IFV\n.\n# Hypothyroidism; Continue home Levothyroxine\n.\n# Transaminitis/Elevated Pancreatic Enzymes: resolved in MICU\nwith hydration\n.\n# FEN; continued regular diet\n.\n# [**Month/Year (2) 5**]; continued home coumadin at a lower dose due to concerns\nof interaction with cipro.  Pt was placed on a PPI\n.\n# Code status: DNR/DNI per conversation with patient and\npatient's daughter. Also documented on previous\nhospitalizations.
