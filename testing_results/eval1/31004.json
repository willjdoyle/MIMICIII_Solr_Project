Axial\nlong TR, long TE fast spin echo, and gradient echo imaging was\nperformed. Comparison to a cervical spine CT of [**2155-4-12**].\n\nFINDINGS: The study is limited by motion artifact. There are\ndegenerative changes, most marked at C4-5 with canal narrowing\nand probable encroachment on the spinal cord, although this is\npoorly evaluated due to motion. The study is of limited\nreliability for detecting ligamentous injury. No definite\nligamentous tears are detected. However, there is a small amount\nof tissue edema or fluid anterior to the C3 through C5 vertebral\nbodies. This may represent hemorrhage, perhaps suggesting a\nligamentous compromise. If there is clinical suspicion of\nligamentous injury, a follow up MR examination may be helpful.\n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)\n\nReason: folow up pntx\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n42 year old man with\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\nfolow up pntx\nPORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST [**2155-4-14**]\n\nINDICATION: Pneumothorax.\n\nCardiac and mediastinal contour are unchanged in appearance.\nWorsening right basilar lung opacity with adjacent increasing\nright pleural effusion. Multiple rib fractures are noted\nbilaterally. Known spinal fractures are better demonstrated on\nrecent CT torso of [**2155-4-12**]. Healed right clavicular\nfracture incidentally noted.\n\nCT CHEST ABDOMEN PELVIS\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Posterior right rib fractures of the seventh through twelfth\nrib, and\nfourth through seventh rib on the right anteriorly.\n2.  Comminuted left scapular fracture without extension to the\nglenohumeral\njoint.\n3.  Left transverse process fractures at T6 through T11 and L1\nthrough L4.\n4.  T9, L1 and L4 vertebral body fractures without retropulsion.\n\n7.  Bilateral inferior pubic ramus fractures and bilateral\nsuperior ramus\nfractures.\n8. Multiple small foci of intrapleural air on the right\nconsistent with tiny\npneumothoraces.\n9.  Several small foci adjacent to rib fractures low in the\nabdomen likely\nlocated in the soft tissues, rather than the peritoneal space.\n10.  Posterior opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally and\nupper lobes are\npresent and may represent atelectasis and/or consolidation, with\nearly\ncontusion a possibility.\n11.  Hypodense right renal lesion, too small to characterize.\n12.  Mild stranding of the mediastinal fat with multiple small\nlymph nodes,\nsignificance of which is uncertain, however, the aorta and great\nvessels\nappear intact.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient was admitted to the TSICU from the ER for his multiple\nrib and spinal fractures.  His pain was controlled with a PCA\nand the acute pain service felt this was sufficient control.\nOrthopedics evaluated the patient's fractures by exam and\nimaging and his c-collar was removed.  His vertebral fractures\nwere all stable in appearance.  He was transferred to the floor\nwithout difficulty.
