Additionally\nthere is a moderate amount of hemorrhage in the lateral\nventricles. Areas of low attenuation are visualized in the grey\nand white matter of the right frontal and parietal lobes. There\nare multiple small areas of density seen in the right\nfrontoparietal lobe region as well of unknown etiology. Most, if\nnot all, of these are probably subarachnoid in location. There\nis evbidence of prior surgery with fixation in the cervical\nspine on the scout view.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Mild-to-moderate amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the\nanterior cranial fossa.\n2. Moderate amount of hemorrhage in the lateral ventricles.\n3. Encephalomalacia right hemisphere, probably remote. Clinical\ncorrelation suggested.\n4.

Again demonstrated is a low-density\nright frontal subdural collection, which is stable in appearance\nsince the prior examination. Stable areas of low attenuation are\ndemonstrated within the right frontal, temporal, and parietal\nregions with associated encephalomalacia, unchanged since the\nprior exam. Tiny punctate calcifications are also again seen\nwithin the right hemisphere.\n\nThere are no new areas of intercranial hemorrhage or mass effect\ndemonstrated. There is no shift in midline structures. The\nventricles are stable in size.\n\nThere is interval improvement in the degree of mucosal\nthickening seen within the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses. There\nis continued opacification of both mastoid air cells.\nSurrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.\n\nIMPRESSION: Minimal decrease in amount of intraventricular and\nsubarachnoid blood. Stable appearance of the ventricles. Stable\nright frontal low-density subdural collection. No new areas of\nhemorrhage or mass effect identified.\n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2177-11-16**] 8:27 AM\n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)\n\nReason: fevers, secretions\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n73 year old man with trauma.\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\nfevers, secretions\nCHEST, SINGLE AP FILM\n\nHistory of trauma with fever and increased secretions.\n\nThe tracheostomy tube is 5 cm above the carina. Left subclavian\nCV line is in distal SVC. No pneumothorax. There are multiple\nleft-sided rib fractures with a small left pleural effusion and\natelectasis at the left lung base. Status post fusion lower\ncervical spine. A focal opacity in the right lower zone is\nlikely composite rib and vascular density.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient admitted to the trauma service. Neurosurgery and\nOrthopedics immediately consulted. Patient loaded with Dilantin,\nICP bolt placed because of low GCS 4. He underwent serial head\nCT scans which were stable. His pubic symphysis diastasis was\nevaluated by Orthopedics; no surgical intervention. He underwent\ntracheostomy and percutaneous PEG placement on [**2177-11-13**]; his\nTF's are currently being cycled (see page 1 diet section).\nRespiratory therapy has been following for his copious\nsecretions; does require frequent suctioning and he is on trach\nmask.
