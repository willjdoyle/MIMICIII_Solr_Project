The patient was an unrestrained\npassenger, and she was expelled out of the car resulting in\nthe car landing on top of her.  This is how the patient was\nfound by the paramedics.  Having a difficult time with the\nexhortation process.\n\nShe was med-flighted to the [**Hospital1 188**] with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Scale of 15.  She was complaining\nof right pelvic pain.  Upon arrival, and after the initial\ntrauma survey was done, there were no other obvious injuries\nbut she was somehow tachycardic with a blood pressure in the\n100s.  For this reason, she was aggressively resuscitated in\nthe trauma bay.\n\nOnce her vital signs were stable, she was taken to the CAT\nscanner for a CT of her head, abdomen, and pelvis.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Past medical history was\nnoncontributory.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   She had no surgery before.\n\nALLERGIES:  She had no known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient was not taking any\nmedications.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  Portuguese-speaking.  She\nhas two children.  She denied any ethanol, tobacco, or\nintravenous drug abuse.\n\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   The head CT was negative as well as the\ninitial trauma series.\n\nA chest CT revealed lung edema, especially on the dependent\nlower part.  There was some amount of free fluid within the\nabdomen.  There were no solid abdominal organ lesions.  No\nfree air was identified.  The free fluid was low-density, and\nit was unclear what the etiology or origin of it was.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Since the patient still remained\ntachycardic, and there was a significant amount of lung\nedema, the patient was returned to the trauma bay where she\nwas intubated, and a diagnostic peritoneal lavage was\nperformed.  The diagnostic peritoneal lavage was negative,\nand the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to\ncontinue her monitoring for frequent neurologic checks.\n\nOvernight, she remained hemodynamically stable, and she was\nextubated without any problems the next morning.  A repeat\nchest x-ray showed resolving resolution of her lung edema.\n\nThat day, upon neurologic examination and evaluation, she was\nagain complaining of numbness of her right lower extremity.\nThe numbness extended from her ankle all the way up to her\nproximal thigh anteriorly only.\n\nA Neurology consultation was obtained, and they suggested\nthat this was plexopathy probably related to the compression\nthat she suffered underneath the car from her accident.  The\nrecommendation at that time was to follow up with them in one\nmonth, and that this would progressively improve.\n\nAfter two days in the unit, Ms. [**Known lastname 42020**] was stable enough\nto be transferred to the floor on CC6.  She continued to\nambulate with the help of Physical Therapy and the nursing\nstaff.  Physical Therapy noted that she had a mild foot drop\nupon ambulation.  Once again, after we thoroughly evaluated\nthe patient, she was able dorsiflex her right foot, having\nmotor function totally preserved.  She continued to complain\nof numbness anteriorly in the region previously described.\n\nBy hospital days five and six, she remarkably improved, being\nable to ambulate almost independently with the help of\nPhysical Therapy and the nursing staff.\n\nBy hospital day seven, she was tolerating a good diet, and a\nPhysical Therapy consultation for home services was obtained.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   She was discharged from the\nhospital on [**2116-7-12**] in good condition and on oral pain\nmedication.\n\nDISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  She was instructed to follow up with the\n[**Hospital 878**] Clinic in one month and also to make a follow-up\nappointment in the Trauma Clinic so we could see her wound.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 11889**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 26544**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2116-7-12**]  12:46\nT:  [**2116-7-16**]  09:01\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 42021**]\n",
