She was driving at 40 mph when\nshe suddenly began feeling sweaty, nauseous and dizzy as if she\nwas going to pass out. The next thing she remembers is being\nawoken in her crashed car by sternal rub. She was GCS of 15\nafter being awakened. Per report she t-boned another car and hit\na trash bin on a sidewalk by the Cheesecake Factory. On arrival\nto the ED her blood glucose was 95.  She endorsed only\nmid-low-back pain, denying HA, dizziness, vision changes, focal\nweakness, paresthesias or numbness.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nLow back pain\nHeadaches\nRight arm parasthesias\n\nSocial History:\nLives with her mother and special-needs sister.

No fractures or other acute traumatic injury seen.\n2. Fibroid uterus.\n3. 3.7 cm left adnexal cyst. If the patient is still\nmenstruating, then follow up with pelvic ultrasound is\nrecommended in six weeks. If the patient is postmenopausal, then\na follow up pelvic ultrasound is recommended in three months for\nfurther [**Year/Month/Day 2742**].\n\nCT HEAD\nIMPRESSION: 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm area of hyperdensity located\nwithin the posterior aspect of the right pons, likely\nhemorrhage,\nbut an underlying vascular malformation (ie. capillary\ntelangiectasia) or mass is not excluded. Recommend MR for\nfurther\n[**Year/Month/Day 2742**].\n\nCT C-Spine\nIMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment. Multilevel degenerative\nchanges, most prominent at level C6-C7 with mild posterior disc\nbulge resulting in mild central canal stenosis.\n\nMRI brain:\nFindings are most suggestive of a cavernoma with adjacent\ndevelopmental venous\nanomaly. No evidence of underlying nodular or mass-like\nenhancement. Given\nlack of surrounding edema, acute hemorrhage in this area is\nunlikely. Follow\nup MRI can be performed to assess for any change if clinical\nconcern persists\n\nRepeat CT head [**2111-1-30**]:\n 1.0cm hyperdense lesion in right superoposterior pons, likely a\n\ncavernoma\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted to the trauma service on [**2111-1-29**] after\na loss of consciousness which resulted in an MVC. The only\nabnormality on [**Date Range 2742**] for traumatic injury found was a\npontine cavernoma suspicious for slow hemorrhage.\n\nNeuro: Due to the finding of the cavernoma, both neurology and\nneurosurgery were consulted.  Neurology thought it was likely\nthat the cavernoma was bleeidng slowly, causing her symptoms and\nsubsequent accident. She did, however, maintain normal mental\nstatus for her entire hospitalization. As cavernomas can be\ngenetic, neurology said screening siblings and daughter as\nout-patient could be considered. Both teams recommended follow\nup with the neurosurgeon Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Additionally, the\nneurosurgery team recommended follow up with ENT as an\nout-patient for [**First Name (STitle) 2742**] of chronic vertigo symptoms.\nAdditionally, while admitted, the patient took oral pain\nmedications with excellent control of pain.  Prior to discharge,\nshe was verbally instructed not to drive by several parties,\nincluding the trauma team.\n\nCV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;\nvital signs were routinely monitored and were normal. A syncope\nwork-up was initiated, including cycling cardiac enzymes\n(negative x 4), ECG on arrival (NSR) and monitoring on telemetry\nx 2 days (no significant arrhthymias noted).  The patient will\nneed to have an echocardiogram as an out-patient to evaluate for\nwall motion abnormalities, valvular dysfunction or chamber\nenlargement.  She had no murmurs on cardiac exam.\n\nPulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;\nvital signs were routinely monitored.\n\nGI/GU: After admission, the patient was resuscitated with IV\nfluids until tolerating oral intake. Her diet was advanced when\nappropriate, which was tolerated well. Intake and output were\nclosely monitored.\n\nProphylaxis: The patient not started on subcutaneous heparin\nduring this stay, given the concern for bleeding cavernoma, but\nwas encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible,\nwhich she did on HD1.  She took a PPI while admitted.\n\nMSK: The pt did complain of low back pain after the accident,\nwith stable neurologic exam as noted above as well as no\nincontinence, LE weakness, fevers, decreased rectal tone or\nother concerning symptoms.  She was treated for this with\nPercocet.  Additionally, her c-collar was cleared on HD#1 as she\nhad no cervical tenderness and full painless ROM.\n\nAt the time of discharge on HD#3, the patient was doing well,\nafebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,\nambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well\ncontrolled.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nIbuprofen, MVI, primrose oil.\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Noted by neuro to have:\n[**Hospital1 **]-occular diplopia worse on distant gaze. Slight palsy of left\neye on lateral gaze.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nYou were admitted to the trauma service at [**Hospital1 18**] after your\nmotor vehicle collision.\n*In [**Hospital1 2742**] after your accident, you were found to have a\nlesion in your brainstem called a Cavernoma (a malformed vein).\nYou were evaluated by neurology and neurosurgery, who thought\nyou were safe to go home at this time. However, it is important\nto carefully monitor your condition and, if you develop any of\nthe warning symptoms below, please call or return to the ED.\n* Additionally, neurosurgery has recommended that you follow up\nwith the ENT (ear nose and throat) doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2742**] of\nyour vertigo (sensation of room spinning).\n*Given the loss of consiousness prior to your accident, you were\nkept in the hospital to evaluate your heart with continuous\nmonitoring (to look for any abnormal heart rhythms) and blood\ntests (to look for a heart attack).  No abnormalites of these\ntests were found.  You will need to have an ultrasound\n[**Last Name (Titles) 2742**] of your heart (called an echocardiogram) as an\nout-pattient.  Please talk to your regular doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 111122**]g this test.\n\n* Car accidents very commonly cause muscle strains and aches,\nespecially in the shoulders and low back.  Symptoms often\ndevelop a few hours after the accident, and can last from [**12-22**]\ndays.  Apply cold compresses for the first 24-48 hours, and hot\npacks thereafter.\n* You should plan on resting for a few days until you feel well.\n Many people get more sore for 1-2 days before starting to feel\nbetter.\n* Over the counter pain-relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil,\nMotrin) are very helpful (unless your doctor has told you not to\ntake this medication.)\n* Please resume all regular home medications and take any new\nmeds as ordered.\n* Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking any\nnarcotic pain medication. You may have constipation when taking\nnarcotic pain medications (oxycodone, percocet, vicodin,\nhydrocodone, dilaudid, etc.); you should continue drinking\nfluids, you may take stool softeners, and should eat foods that\nare high in fiber.\n\nWarning signs:\nCall your doctor or return to the Emergency Department right\naway if any of the following problems develop:\n* [**Name2 (NI) **] or worsening pain in your head, chest or abdomen (belly).\n* Difficulty breathing or fevers greater than 101 degrees (F)\n* Numbness, tingling, weakness or shooting pain in an arm or\nleg.\n* New trouble controlling your bowels or urine.\n* If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your\nmedications.\n* You have recurrent loss of consciousness in the next 6 months.\n* You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing,\ntightness, a rapid heartbeat or palpitations.\n* You have new or worsening difficulty breathing.\n* You develop severe headache, dizziness, confusion or change in\nbehavior.\n* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that\nconcern you.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease call Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Clinic for an\nappointment. Phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 41**]. Location [**Hospital Ward Name **] 6E.  The purpose\nof your [**Hospital Ward Name 2742**] is to rule out a vestibular cause of your\nvertigo, as recommended by neurosurgery.\n\nYou will need to follow up with Neurosurgery 1 week after you\nare seen by ENT.  Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 88**] for an appointment\nwith Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].\n\nPlease follow up with Trauma Clinic in [**1-21**] weeks.
