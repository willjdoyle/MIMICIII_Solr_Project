There are stable emphysematous bullae within the\nright upper lobe as well as several left mid and lower lateral\nrib fractures and associated pleural thickening. The lungs\nremain clear. The heart is normal in size.\n\nCT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2108-5-11**] 5:33 PM\n\nCT HEAD W/O CONTRAST\n\nReason: eval: bleed\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n50 year old man s/p run over by car (on MCC)\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\neval: bleed\nCONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.\n\nINDICATION: Run over by car, evaluate for bleed.\n\nCOMPARISON: None.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT scan.\n\nNOTES: This is a redictation. The original dictation was\nperformed immediately following completion of the study, however\nwas lost.\n\nFINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.\nThere is no shift of normally midline structures or\nhydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation appears grossly\nintact. Right parietal scalp hematoma is identified. Mild\nmucosal thickening noted within the maxillary, ethmoid, and\nfrontal air spaces.\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Right\nparietal scalp hematoma. Sinus disease as described.\n\nCT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2108-5-11**] 5:34 PM\n\nCT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST\n\nReason: eval: fx\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n50 year old man s/p run over by car (on MCC)\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\neval: fx\nCONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.\n\nINDICATION: Run over by car, evaluate for fracture.\n\nCOMPARISON: None.\n\nTECHNIQUE: No evidence of acute fracture or spondylolisthesis.\nThere is no evidence of abnormal prevertebral soft tissue\nswelling.

Left\npneumothorax is better evaluated on the CT of the torso.\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture, abnormal prevertebral\nsoft tissue swelling. Mild degenerative changes seen within the\ncervical spine. Left pneumothorax better evaluated on CT of the\ntorso.\n\nCT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2108-5-11**] 5:34 PM\n\nCT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST\n\nReason: eval: inj\nField of view: 45 Contrast: OPTIRAY\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n50 year old man s/p run over by car (on MCC)\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\neval: inj\nCONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.\n\nINDICATION: Run over by car.\n\nCOMPARISON: None.\n\nTECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen and\npelvis were obtained with IV contrast. Multiplanar reformatted\nimages were also displayed.\n\nCT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of\ntraumatic aortic injury. There is a small-to-moderate sized\nleft-sided pneumothorax. Severe bullous changes are noted within\nboth lungs, most prominent at the right apex. Increased ground\nglass opacities seen at the lung bases, possibly representing\ncontusion or aspiration. No pathologically enlarged mediastinal,\nhilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy is identified. Multiple\nbilateral rib fractures are identified. Fractures are seen in\nthe left second, third, fourth, fifth (2 fractures), sixth (2\nfractures), seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs. Fracture is also\nseen in the right fourth, fifth, eighth, and possibly ninth\nribs.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder,\nspleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear\nunremarkable. There is no evidence of free air or free fluid\nwithin the abdomen. Visualized portions of bowel appear\nunremarkable.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid appear\nunremarkable. The bladder appears decompressed, likely secondary\nto Foley catheterization. There is no evidence of free fluid\nwithin the pelvis. No pelvic bone fractures are identified.\nSmall amount of stranding is seen in the left flank/buttock area\nconsistent with a small soft tissue hematoma.\n\nBONE WINDOWS: Multiple bilateral rib fractures as described. No\nsuspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.\n\nMultiplanar reformatted images confirm the axial findings.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Mild-to-moderate left-sided pneumothorax with multiple\nbilateral rib fractures as described above. No evidence of acute\nsolid organ injury.\n2. Poorly defined ground glass opacity is seen predominantly at\nthe lung bases, possibly representing contusion versus\naspiration.\n3. Emphysematous changes with severe bullous changes most\nprominent at the right apex.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient admitted to the trauma service. He was admitted to the\nTrauma ICU for close observation and was eventually transferred\nto the regular nursing unit. A mild to moderate sized left\npneumothorax was identified on CT of chest; serial chest\nradiographs were stable and did not reveal an increase in this.\nHe is experiencing pain from his multiple rib fractures; his\npain is being controlled with po Dilaudid and Motrin 600 qid.\nHis diet was advanced and he is tolerating this well.\n\nHe was instructed to follow up with his primary doctor in the\nnext 2-3 weeks and to follow up with Trauma Clinic as needed for\nissues concerning [**Last Name (un) **] related to his crash.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
