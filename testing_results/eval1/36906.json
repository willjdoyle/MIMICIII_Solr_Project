Her initial injuries were\nlimited to a sore shoulder and some bruises on her lower\nextremities.  However, while she was undergoing a CT scan, she\nhad a 45 second generalized tonic clonic seizure, which resolved\nwithout medication.  After recovering she underwent an MRI,\nwhich showed no abnormalities, and an EEG which showed no\nepileptiform activity.  Apart from a mild headache, and amnesia\nfor the time period surrounding the accident, the patient had no\nother neurologic abnormalities.  It was suspected that this\nseizure was simply a post-concussive seizure.  The patient was\ninstructed to avoid driving for 6 months, to avoid riding her\nbicycle for at least 2 weeks, and to take precautions to avoid\nfurther head trauma during her recovery period.  She was\ndischarged with Percocet for pain control and Zofran for nausea.\n She will have a follow-up appointment in the first-time seizure\nclinic, and will also undergo standard neurocognitive testing.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
