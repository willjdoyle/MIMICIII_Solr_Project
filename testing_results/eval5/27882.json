Closure of maxillocutaneous. elevation repositioning of\n    upper lip left upper lip\n\nANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTE:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a very unfortunate young\nman who initially presented to his dermatologist with a small\nlesion on the left cheek. This was subsequently cauterized on\nseveral occasions and kept on recurring. Biopsy eventually\nrevealed a malignant melanoma for which he has been treated\nwith a radical head and neck resection and resurfacing with a\npedicle flap based on the superficial temporal vessels. At\nthe present time he has extensive intracerebral metastases\nwhich have been treated with radiation therapy. He is awake,\nalert, coherent without significant neurologic deficits. The\nmain problems have been continued drainage from the maxillary\ncutaneous fistula, left side of his cheek as well as an\ninability to close his lips of hold fluid in due to the\nelevation of the left upper lip. He is brought to the\noperating room today knowing full well that he does have\nmetastatic disease for lowering of the upper lip and\nredirection of the fistula into the nasal cavity. The\nsignificant debulking of biscuited flap in the left cheek was\nalso done and this provided enough tissue to reroute the\nsinus.\n\nPROCEDURE:  With the patient on the operating room table in\nthe supine position with the head tilted degrees, general\nendotracheal anesthetic was induced without difficulty. Full\nhead and neck prepping and draping was then done. Appropriate\ndigital pics were taken. The lines for the incisions were\nthen marked out at the base of the previous flap transfer to\nthe left cheek. Following this, this area to be dissected was\nand injected with 4 cc of 1% lidocaine plus epinephrine. When\na good epinephrine affect had been achieved, an incision was\nmade around from 9 o'clock to 10 o'clock around the inferior\nportion of the rather biscuited flap of the left cheek.\nDissection progressed down to the maxilla and the soft tissue\nattached to the maxilla was then undermined down to the level\nof the roots of the teeth. Care was taken not to break into\nthe lingual sulcus of the upper lip. However, this\nsignificantly allowed lower repositioning of the upper lip.\nThe excess bulk of soft tissue was then excised from the flap\nwhich was fairly thick. We were able to excise tissue from\nthe inferior two to fifth of the flap, superior portion,\nwhich contained a vascular pedicle and was kept anatomically\nintact. This extended up into the lower lip region.\n\nOnce the debulking had been done, the flap could then be\nrotated medially and inferiorly over a significant\ndifference. The cutaneous fistula was then addressed. The\nlining of the sinus was excised and with this we were able to\nelevate the cheek flap more and while tangentially excising\nmuch of this excess tissue we encountered tannish whitish\nalmost gelatinous tissue which did not appear normal but we\nwere not surprised that the frozen section on this biopsy was\nconsistent with a malignant spindle cell type tumor.\nWe are assuming that much of the maxillary sinus is filled\nwith this tissue. The cheek flap was then brought down and\nwas rotated medially toward the left side of the nose and\ninferiorly. A layered closure was used inferiorly, first\nanchoring the lip tissue down with 3-0 Vicryl sutures and\nthen insetting the flap in layers using 5-0 Vicryl and 5-0\nrunning intracuticular Monocryl suture. This was then\nreinforced with multiple simple everting interrupted 5-0\nnylon sutures. The ala of the nose which was pulled inward\nand internally compresses was then released. This was then\nsutured to the medial aspect of the cheek flap which had been\nrotated into the nose. This then allowed redirection of the\nsinus into the nasal cavity. This area was closed with Vicryl\nand 5-0 nylon sutures.\n\nPreoperatively we had planned on doing a medial canthopexy to\ncorrect the severe medial ectropion of the eye.\nPreoperatively he was unduly swollen and this I am sure is\ndue to the tumor in the area. We did not release and skin\ngraft this area today. This was not his [**Last Name 16423**] problem. At the\nend of the procedure a light compression dressing was\napplied. He was then awakened and returned to the recovery\nroom in satisfactory condition. He will remain as an\ninpatient overnight.\n\n                        [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5385**], [**MD Number(1) 24266**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 67933**]\nPathology Examination\nName Birthdate    Age     Sex Pathology #     [**Hospital1 18**] [**Known lastname 67934**],[**Known firstname 275**]       [**2097-10-8**]    69 Male      [**-6/4995**] [**Numeric Identifier 67931**]\nReport to:   DR.

Intraoperative frozen section diagnosis by\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] reads:  \"Recurrent spindle cell neoplasm\". The\nentire frozen section remnant is submitted in cassette A.\nPart 2 is additionally labeled \"malignant melanoma permanent\"\nand consists of two pieces of pink to tan soft tissue that\nmeasure in aggregate 2.5 x 2 x 1.8 cm.  The specimen is inked in\nblack.  It is serially-sectioned to reveal areas of tan\n'papillations' that measure up to 1.2 cm. The entire specimen is\nsubmitted in B-C.\nPart 3 is additionally labeled \"plaque left cheek\" and consists\nof a 3.5 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm piece of fibrous and adipose tissue with\nfocal areas of hemorrhage. No masses are identified. The\nspecimen is inked in black and sectioned to reveal unremarkable\nfibrous tissue. The entire specimen is submitted in D-F.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted and underwent left facial flap revision\non [**2167-1-1**] (please refer to operative note for details).  The\npatient tolerated the procedure well and was initially on\nexperiencing mild bloody drainage from his left nostril and was\ntransferred to the floor.  However, the bleeding was persistent\ndespite numerous gauze, surgicel, merocel packings and pressure\ndressings.  His hematocrit was monitored daily and was overall\nstable without transfusion.  His electrolytes were checked on\n[**1-3**] secondary to an episode of confusion.  His sodium level\nwas 118.  He was placed on 1 liter fluid restriction daily and\nserum/urine osmolarities were sent (Serum Osm =248; Urine Osm\n=463).  His hyponatremia resolved on fluid restriction and his\nsodium was in normal range at discharge.\n\nThe oncology service was consulted for and the patient was seen\non [**1-3**].  They explained to the patient that would follow-up\nwith him in clinic to continue discussion of systemic therapy\nwhen he had recovered from surgery.  They attributed his\nlongstanding memory problems to radiation damage.  They agreed\nwith fluid restriction for his hyponatremia.\n\nThe neurology service was consulted and they saw the patient on\n[**1-3**].  Their recommendations in agreement with the fluid\nrestriction for his hyponatremia.  However, they did not believe\nthe hyponatremia was related to the carbamazepine as he had been\non a stable dose for several years.  In addition, based on\nhistory this medication was for trigeminal neuralgia and not for\nseizures.  They commented on the presence of extensive signal\nabnormalities in the left temporal lobe and questioned tumor\nrecurrence vs. radiation necrosis.\n\nThe medicine service was consulted for his hyponatremia and they\nwere in agreement with fluid restriction and also recommended\nrepeating labs daily and not to give hypertonic saline.\n\nHe was seen by the ENT surgeons on [**1-5**] and they placed his\ncurrent merocel packing.  They recommended to keep the packing\nin for now and to use Afrin for 4 days.  They believed that the\nbleeding appeared to be coming from necrotic or neoplastic\nmucosa, which may not heal normally and therefore, were\nconcerned that when packs are removed, the tissue will continue\nbleeding.  This led to the pursuit of neuroembolization for\ndefinitive management.  Neuroembolization of the left maxillary\nartery was performed on [**1-6**] by the neurointerventional\nradiologists.  However, despite the successful embolization, the\npatient continued to have a slow bleed around the nasal packing.\n The patient was admitted directly to the SICU after the\nprocedure as a precaution.  But he did well post-procedure and\nwas soon transferred back to the floor.\n\nAfter discussions between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5385**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 67935**] (patient's PCP\nat [**Name9 (PRE) 2025**]) and the patient, it was decided that the patient would\ngo home and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 67935**] within one week for\nfurther management coordination.  The patient was in agreement\nwas discharged home on [**1-7**] in overall stable condition with\nthe nasal packing intact.  He and his friend were instructed to\ncall/return to [**Hospital1 18**] if there were any increase in bleeding or\nif the patient became symptomatic.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nCarbamazepine (tegretol) 200mg [**Hospital1 **]\nLorazepam (ativan) 1 mg daily\nTrazadone 50mg daily\nProvigil 200mg daily\nErythromycin eye ointment\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
