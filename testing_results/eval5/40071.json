Tonic-Clonic Seizures: On admission there was report of a\nhistory of seizure disorder with recent witnessed epileptic\nactivity in setting of likely infection and medication known to\nlower seizure threshold. The patient was confused on arrival to\nthe ED which was attributed to a post-ictal state with CT scan\nat OSH showing no evidence of stroke and no significant\nmetabolic derangement on laboratory testing. The patient was\nadmitted to the ICU and started on Keppra for seizure\nprophylaxis by neurology recommendations and his antibiotic was\nchanged to Ceftriaxone. His mental status was significantly\nimproved the morning after admission. The patient was\nsubsequently transferred from the ICU to the medicine service.\nAs part of the patient's seizure workup, an MRI was ordered\nwhich revealed two heterogeneously enhancing lesions in the left\nparietal lobe, with suspicion for a malignant glioma. An EEG\nrevealed diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy but no\nepileptiform activity was noted. The information was presented\nto the patient and given the progressive nature of his\nParkinson's disease and debilitated state he chose not to\nundergo any further evaluation of the brain lesions. The patient\nclearly expressed the risks of not pursuing any further\nevaluation or treatment and was willing to accept the\nconsequences. The patient was discharged on Keppra 500 mg twice\na day for seizure prophylaxis which was the dose started on\nadmissionto [**Hospital1 18**].\n.\n2. Right Lower Extremity DVT: Several days into his admission,\nthe patient developed right lower extremity erythema and\nswelling. A lower extremity ultrasound was performed and\nrevealed a right posterior tibial vein thrombosis. Vascular\nsurgery was consulted and recommended repeat ultrasound in 48\nhours. Repeat ultrasound revealed presence of the thrombosis in\nthe right peroneal and right popliteal veins in addition to the\noriginal location. Vascular surgery was again contact[**Name (NI) **] and an\nIVC filter was placed without complication. Post-procedure\nevaluation did not reveal any hematoma or venous hum at the\nsite. Vascular surgery reported that this patient would not be a\ncandidate for IVC filter removal and that no follow-up was\nnecessary.\n.\n3. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient was admitted two days\ninto a course of Ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection\nthat was culture positive for Citrobacter, which was\npan-sensitive. Given the neurological complications associated\nwith Ciprofloxacin in the elderly, the patient was switched to\nCeftriaxone. The patient completed a total of 10 days of\nantibiotics (from the start of the Ciprofloxacin) as an\ninpatient. Of note, the patient was transferred to the medicine\nservice with a foley in place but was discontinued. The patient\nsubsequently failed to void, was started on Tamsulosin for\npresumed BPH and the foley was replaced. Two days later the\npatient failed to void once again and was found to have 700 cc\nof urine on bladder scan. The foley was again replaced and was\npresent at discharge. Given the patient's urinary retention\nobserved as an inpatient, it is likely that this contributed to\nthe development of his urinary tract infection. ** The foley may\nbe possible to discontinue as an outpatient and another trial is\nlikely warranted. **\n.\n4. Aspiration Risk: The patient was evaluated by speech and\nswallow in the ICU and was started on a dysphagia diet and\nnectar-thickened liquids due to high aspiration risk. The\npatient repeatedly expressed interest in eating a regular diet.\nThe patient again failed a bedside evaluation. It was decided\nthat while inpatient that he should remain on the recommended\ndiet. The patient clearly understood the risks of eating a\nregular diet and drinking normal liquids, particuarly that\naspiration was high likely. He stated that given his underlying\nillness he would assume the risk. ** The patient again expressed\ninterest in eating a regular diet at discharge, understood the\nrisks and demonstrated clear capacity to make his own decisions.\nThis should be re-addressed as an outpatient but the patient\nshould likely be allowed to eat the diet he wishes. **\n.\n5. Right-sided Weakness: The patient reported chronic\nright-sided weakness on presentation that most likely\nrepresented an old neurologic deficit from his prior CVA that\nwas exacerbated by worsening malnutrition and acute illness. The\npatient's listed PCP was called to discuss the patient's\nbaseline, however the PCP had only known the patient for the\nseveral days that he was at the nursing home, and could not\nprovide much background information. The patient was continued\non Sinemet although it seemed unlikely that Parkinson's disease\nwas a major contributor to this particular problem.\n.\n6. Parkinson's Disease: The patient was admitted on Sinemet for\nhis Parkinson's disease of unknown duration. The patient had\nmasked-facies and bradykinesia with some cogwheel rigidity of\nthe upper extremities on examination. The patient was continued\non his Sinement during this hospitalization without problem.\n.\n7. Leukocytosis: The patient had a normal white count on\ntransfer to the. Several days into his stay on the medicine\nfloor, the patient's white count was elevated to 13. The patient\nreported a new cough that was concerning for a possible\naspiration event. A chest x-ray revealed a patchy left lower\nlobe opacity that was possibly increased over an outside film\nscanned into the [**Hospital1 18**] system and likely represented atelectasis\nvs possible early infectious infiltrate. The patient had a known\nUTI as per above. Given the location of the infiltrate on chest\nx-ray, there was low suspicion for an aspiration event but one\ncould not be ruled out definitely. Given that the patient was\nalready on a third generation cephalosporin and clinical\nsuspicion was low for another infectious process, no additional\nantibiotic coverage was added. The following day the patient's\nwhite count was down to 11.3 and was 8.8 the following day, the\nmorning of discharge.\n.\n8. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit was 37 on admission. The\npatient received vigorous hydration in the ICU prior to transfer\nto the medicine floor and his hematocrit declined to 32.8 at\ntime of transfer to the medicine service. Given his poor oral\nintake, the patient was continued on intermittent fluids on the\nfloor. His hematocrit stabilized at approximately 30 and\nremained so for the next eight days until the time of discharge.\nThe patient was guaiac negative. Iron studies were ordered and\nwere consistent with anemia of chronic disease (calTIBC 142,\nFerritin 894, TRF 109) which was consistent with the patient's\nunderlying disease process.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. Carbidopa-Levodopa - 25-100 1 Tablet(s) Four times daily\n2. Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) - 100 mcg 1 Syringe(s) monthly\n3. Tylenol\n4. Mylanta prn\n5. Biscodyl\n6.

After lengthy discussions with you, it was\ndecided that you did not want to pursue further treatment.\nAlthough you do not want to have treatment of your tumors, you\nhave been given medication to help prevent the seizures that the\ntumors are likely causing. Also, on admission to the hospital\nyou were being treated for a urinary tract infection with an\nantibiotic called Ciprofloxacin. As this medication can be\nassociated with neurological side-effects in elderly\nindividuals, you were changed to another antibiotic called\nCeftriaxone. You completed your course of this antibiotic in the\nhospital and will not need any further antibiotics.\n.\nThe following changes have been made to your medications:\n.\n1. Start Keppra 500 mg by mouth twice a day, in the morning and\nin the evening. This medication will help prevent seizures.\n2. Start Vitamin D 400 unit tablet. Take one tablet twice a day.\n\n3. Start Calcium carbonate 500 mg tablet. Take one tablet by\nmouth three times a day.\n4. Start Tamsulosin 0.4 mg tablet by mouth. Take one tablet by\nmouth at night. This medication will help prevent urinary\nretention.\n5. Stop Ciprofloxacin. You completed your course of antibiotics\nin the hospital for your urinary tract infection.\n.\nNo other changes were made to your medications. You should\ncontinue taking all other medications as previously prescribed.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease follow-up with your outpatient physicians as you feel\nappropriate.\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2150-11-11**]",
