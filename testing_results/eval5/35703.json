Extreme worsening in malignancy in\na short period. Patient is afebrile, without leukocytosis, but\nstarted on Vanc/Zosyn in ED for potential post-obstructive\npneumonia. Patient has history of bilateral PEs, and is on\ntherapeutic lovenox. Initially patient wanted all measures\ntaken. Discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from IP. Given extent of\ndisease burden and impending intubation proceeding with\nintubation did not seem appropriate. Lengthy discussion with the\nfamily regarding goals of care. Discussed potential futility of\nthoracentesis on pleural effusion as not likely to benefit his\nstate. Also patient with dose of lovenox in AM. Given metastatic\ndisease with such poor prognosis decision was made with family\nto make the patient comfort measures. Antibiotics were\ndiscontinued. I maintained the patient on stool softeners, and\nkeppra as I deemed this to be discomforting to the patient if he\nwould have a seizure or become constipated. Discussed pain and\nsedation options with family and patient. He was tachypneic but\nwithout increased cough, secretions or overt pain. He wanted to\nbe awake as much as possible to discuss with his family.\nPatient was placed on comfort measures only, started on morphine\nQ2 Hr IV, ativan Q2 hr, nebs for comfort.  Palliative Care was\nconsulted and measures were taken to set up home with hospice\nper patient and family request.\n\n# Metastatic Cancer: Patient with known throat cancer, and\npresumed lung cancer, with history of mets to brain, bone, and\nlung.  Care measures only taken as above.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**], Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], primary oncologists, were emailed to be kept abreast\nof the situation.\n\n# Bilateral PE: Unlikely source of tachypnea.
