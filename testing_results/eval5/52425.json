He started having headaches in [**2121-6-3**] at which\ntime he was diagnosed with multiple (~7) brain metastases for\nwhich he received [**Year (4 digits) 108337**] and whole brain radiation over 10\nsuccessive treatments. His wife notes that he has had some\nchronic leg weakness but she thinks this may have become worse\nsince completing the radiation. Because his doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 2985**] that\n[**Name5 (PTitle) 108337**] was contributing to a steroid-induced myopathy, they\nstopped the [**Name5 (PTitle) 108337**] at least a month ago according to her. He\nwas scheduled for a bone scan and by OMR notes it is clear that\nhe does have a history of thoracic and lumbar spine metastases.\nHis lower extremity strength did not improve after the\ndiscontinuation of steroids.\n\nHe did not report increasing headaches over the last few days.\nHis appetite has been poor in general. His family states that he\n\nspends most of his days watching tv and does not really get up\nto\nwalk much because of his low back pain and hip pain which is\nchronic. He has been known to confuse the time of day and that\nday of the week lately but they seem to say that is the extent\nof\nhis confusion. They deny ever having seen any seizure activity.\n\nThis morning at around 5 or 6am, his wife heard a huge thud in\nthe bathroom and he appeared to be stuck between the toilet and\nthe door. EMS came and had to break down the door and he was\nfound to be confused, but not foaming at the mouth. There was no\n\nevidence of tongue biting or urinary incontinence apparently.\nThey did note his right side was \"flaccid.\" Upon getting him to\nthe ambulance they noted to some left sided extremity shaking\nwith his eyes deviated to the left. It is not clear how long\nthis\nlasted but 2mg ativan was given and it resolved. He was brought\nhere an intubated at approximately 7am. 100mg hydrocortisone, 1g\n\ndilantin, propofol drip and KCl have been given.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n2. Hypertension.\n3. Emphysema.\n4. Alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy.\n5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n6. Colonic polyps\n7. Lung cancer history as above\n8. Blind from childhood.\n\n\nSocial History:\nlives with family\nHabits: not known\n\nFamily History:\nfamily history of colon cancer\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nExamination: T 99.9 BP 120/83 HR 93 RR 20 100% vented\nGeneral appearance: well appearing, moving around, but intubated\n\nHeart: regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops\nLungs: coarse upper airway sounds bilaterally\nAbdomen: soft, nontender\nExtremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema\n\nMental Status: The patient is on moving around, intermittently\nopening his eyes spontaneously but obviously nonverbal. He is on\n\npropofol drip.\n\nCranial Nerves: The visual fields are full. The optic discs are\natrophied bilaterally with no evidence of hemorrhage or\npapilledema.Dolls' eye maneuver results in horizontal eye\nmovements. The pupils are nonreactive to light. There is no\nobvious facial droop. There is a cough.\n\nSensory/Motor System: He localizes to pain in all 4 extremities\npurposefully. The tone in the lower extremities is increased and\n\nare externally rotated bilaterally.\n\nReflexes: The tendon reflexes are present, symmetric and normal\nin all joints including the Achilles. The plantar reflexes are\nmute bilaterally.\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nImaging: CT head:\nThere is extensive edema throughout the right temporal lobe and\nright frontal lobe without evidence of hematoma. There is\nmidline\nshift of the frontal lobe, subfalcine herniation that is not\nmuch\nchanged from the MRI in [**6-6**]. The ventricles appear to be about\nthe same size as before as well. There is no impending tonsillar\n\nherniation.\n\nEKG: sinus tachy 155bpm, left axis deviation, St depressions in\nV4-6, St elevation III, aVF\n\nRepeat EKG: NSR 92bpm, ST elevation in III, AVF resolved; St\ndepression in C4-6 resolved.\n\nCXR: large gastric bubble, right hilar mass. No obvious\ninfiltrate or consolidation\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n1.  Seizures - 60 year old man with brain metastases from\nadvanced lung cancer, now with at least one witnessed seizure. A\nCT scan was obtained which showed extensive edema which might\nhave been worse from the time his brain was scanned in [**Month (only) **]\n[**2121**]. This in and of itself, in addition to the right frontal\nlobe lesion, may be the explanation for his seizure(s) at\nadmission. There were no other obvious abnormalities in his labs\nto have lowered the seizure threshold. He was admitted to the\nneuro ICU for high dose steroids, seizure prophylaxis, and q1hr\nneuro checks. In the Neuro ICU [**Year (4 digits) **] 10mg x1 was given\nfollowed by 6mg iv q6h. Dilantin was given.  EEG was done.  MRI\nwas done which showed: \"Interval increase in size of the\nmultiple brain metastases.  Stable mass effect. No evidence of\nbrain herniation at this time.\"  Spine MRI showed:\"Drop\nmetastasis at the T12-L1 level on the left.  Diffuse metastatic\ndisease involving the vertebral bodies and the right iliac\nbone.\"  Most likely he needs to be on chronic steroids and\nseizure prophylaxis.\n  He was transferred to the oncology floor for further\nmanagement.  A family discussion was held on [**2121-9-30**]. At which\ntime it was decided to make the patient CMO.  Palliative care\nwas contact[**Name (NI) **] and all medications were discontinued except for\n[**Name (NI) **], Morphine, Ativan, and Dilantin.  He was continued on\nthese medications while appropriate placement was found for him.\n At hospice he should be continued on seizure prophylaxis with\n[**Name (NI) **] and Dilantin.\n\n2.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. -Initially he was\ncontinued on insulin sliding scale for diabetes and steroids.\nThis treatment was stopped when he was made comfort measures\nonly.\n\n3. Hypertension. - Anti-hypertension medications were initially\ncontinued but were all stopped when he was made comfort measures\nonly.\n\n4. FEN - Initially he was NPO as he had not passed a speach and\nswallow evaluation.  He was re-evaluated on [**2121-10-6**] at which\ntime his swallowing ability had recovered sufficiently that it\nwas felt he would be able to have nectar thick pureed liquids.\nHe was continued on this diet.  He was also given his\nmedications by mouth after this evaluation.\n\n5. Code status - His code status was changed on this admission\nto DNR/DNI/CMO based upon the poor prognosis of his metastatic\nlung cancer combined with mental status changes from his brain\nmetastasis.\n\n6.  Pain control - He was continued on Ativan and Morphine for\npain control.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLisinopril, Insulin, MS Contin, Remeron 15mg nightly, Protonix\n(family is unsure of doses)\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. Phenytoin 100 mg/4 mL Suspension Sig: Two Hundred (200) mg PO\nQ8H (every 8 hours).\n2. Dexamethasone 1 mg/mL Drops Sig: Six (6) mg PO Q6H (every 6\nhours).\n3.
