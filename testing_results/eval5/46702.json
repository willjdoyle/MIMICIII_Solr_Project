She\nreports that she began to feel unwell when her husband died in\n[**6-29**] of a stroke - she felt depressed.  In [**7-29**], she developed a\nGI virus and had profuse vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain\nas well as chills and worsening weakness over several weeks,\nunable to keep her mestinon down at times.  She had a headache\nwith this and was prescribed percocet and told to sleep in a\nsoft collar at night to help with neck muscle contraction.  The\nGI virus cleared three weeks ago, but she still felt weak all\nover, as if her myasthenia was getting worse.  Two weeks ago she\nhad fevers and chills at home for about a week, which have since\nresolved (one week ago).  She feels that her speech has become\nsofter and she feels out of breath, particularly when she talks\nor does any amount of exercise.  She doesn't even want to walk,\nbecause it makes her feel markedly weak.  When she swallows, the\nliquid comes out her nose.  She continues to take pills and has\nnot complained of choking on foods or liquids.  Her daughter\nnoticed a left facial droop about 4-5 days ago.  She c/o no new\nnumbness, tingling, diplopia or new visual changes, trouble with\nhearing or headaches except as aforementioned.  She did fall\nseveral weeks ago and struck the right side of her head, but has\nnot had pain at that site since then.  She has had no cp, cough,\ndysuria, or recent GI sx.\n\nPast Medical History:\n-Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] - dx'ed before [**2121**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],\non Mestinon only with no hx use of immunomodulatory agents\n(steroids, cellcept), no hx intubation or hospitalizations for\nher MG, in general under \"very good control.\"  She has baseline\nfatiguable weakness of delt at times, has not had recent ptosis.\n\n-Post-polio syndrome, with bulbar features - soft speech,\noccasional trouble with swallowing\n-HTN\n-Raynaud's phenomenon\n-s/p TAH\n-MVP\n\nSocial History:\nLives alone; husband died in [**6-29**] of stroke at [**Hospital1 112**], daughter\ninvolved with care.  No tob, etoh, drugs.\n\n\nFamily History:\nNo strokes, no MG or neurological d/o's in family.\n\n\nPhysical [**Hospital1 **]:\nNIF -12, FVC  1.05\nT 98.4  HR 55  BP 142/73  RR 14  100%RA\nGeneral appearance: fatigued appearance, elderly white female\nHEENT: moist mucus membranes, clear oropharynx\nNeck: supple, no bruits\nHeart: regular rate and rhythm\nLungs: diminished breath sounds at R>L base\nAbdomen: soft, nontender +bs\nExtremities: warm, well-perfused\nSkull & Spine: Neck movements are full and not painful to\npalpation in the paraspinal soft tissues\n\nMental Status: The patient is alert and attentive, +DOW\nbackwards, registered three objects at 30 seconds and recalled 3\nout of 3 items at 3 minutes. Good knowledge for current events.\nLanguage is [**Hospital1 5235**] with no errors. There is no apraxia or\nagnosia.\n\nCranial Nerves: There is mild ptosis after upgaze for 45\nseconds. The visual fields are full. The optic discs are normal\nin appearance.  Eye movements are normal, with no nystagmus.\nPupils react equally to light, both directly and consensually -\nthough there is <1mm anisocoria with R eye slightly bigger than\nL.  Sensation on the face is [**Hospital1 5235**] to light touch, pin prick.\nThere is a L UMN facial droop.  Hearing is [**Hospital1 5235**] to finger rub.\n The palate elevates in the midline.  The tongue protrudes in\nthe midline and is of normal appearance.\n\nMotor System: Decreased bulk symmetrically throughout, normal\ntone throughout.  There is 4+/5 weakness of neck extensors, and\n4+/5 weakness of R deltoid, 4/5 weakness L deltoid.  The R\ndeltoid has fatiguable weakness after 30 seconds of\nabd/adduction exercises is 4-/5.  R bicep 4+/5, R tricep 4+/5,\nfull at R wrist ext, full R finger ext/flex.

The findings were conveyed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43932**] to the eemergency\nroom at the time of the examination. Neurosurgical consultation\nis recommended with followup.\"\n\nCXR: no pneumonia\n\nVideo Swallow: Poor bolus control, including aspiration of thin\nliquids without spontaneous cough. Please see the report of the\nspeech and swallow pathologist for further information.\n\nPathology: R Temporoparietal mass\nNote:  The tumor infiltrates predominately white matter.  The\nneoplastic cells are small and round with a small amount of\ncytoplasm.  Scattered tumor cells are elongated with coarse\neosinophilic processes. Immunohistochemistry is being performed\non the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and the results\nwill be performed in an addendum.  Glial tumor subtyping and\ngrading will be included in the addendum.\nADDENDUM:\nImmunohistochemistry was performed and reveals a high\nproliferation rate MIB-1 (Ki67) with nuclear staining in >25% of\ntumor nuclei (block B,D).  HMB45 is negative.  The tumor cells\ninfiltrate brain and some areas are seen floating in a loose\nmatrix.  These latter regions show strong GFAP positive staining\nof fibrillary processes (blocks B, D).  Scattered CD68 and LCA\npositive cells are also present blocks (B, D).  The results are\nconsistent with the diagnosis of high grade malignant glioma.\nTumor necrosis and microvascular proliferation are not detected\nin the small sample.  Based solely on the biopsy specimen, the\ndiagnosis is ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA (WHO grade III). Radiologic\nstudies indicate a ring-enhancing cystic mass suggesting the\npossibility of higher grade tumor in unsampled parts of the\ntumor.\n\nMRI head [**2128-10-28**]: The large heterogeneous lesion with necrotic\ncenter and irregularly nodular-enhancing periphery in the left\ntemporal region is again demonstrated. There is no change in the\nperilesional edema and the mild shift of the midline structures.\nNo new lesions are noted. There is compression of the right\nlateral ventricle from the mass effect. Post-biopsy changes are\nnoted in the right frontal region.\nIMPRESSION: Large right temporal lobe necrotic GBM demonstrated\nfor CyberKnife procedure.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nBriefly, 77 year old woman with history of post-polio syndrome\n(bulbar weakness) and overlying myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] on mestinon at\nhome with no past complications, who presents with a combination\nof fatiguable weakness and myasthenic reaction on [**Last Name (un) **], poor\nNIF/FVC consistent with myasthenic crisis, as well as overlying\ncortical sensory signs on the left with motor weakness in UMN\npattern, suggesting a focal lesion in the brain R hemisphere.\nShe was admitted to the neurology ICU with myasthenic crisis and\nnew R temporo-parietal mass on head CT.\n\nNEURO: She was subsequently begun on decadron to decrease the\ncerebral edema associated with the mass and continued intubation\ngiven possible worsening of myasthenia crisis.  No know primary\ntumor and torso CT was negative.  MRI brain with gadolinium\nshowed the right temporal lobe mass being solitary suggestive of\na primary malignant glioma or an isolated metastatic lesion.\nNeurosurgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] and stereotactic brain biopsy was\nperformed on [**10-12**].  Mestinon was resumed post-procedure.\nPathology showed infiltrating glioma which was confirmed by\nimmunophenotyping to be anaplastic astrocytoma.  Post-operative\ncourse was complicated by a Serratia Marcescens pneumonia by BAL\nthat was treated with Ceftazidine x 14 days. Patient was also\ninitiated on 5 day course of IVIG to treat her myasthenia.\nPatient was successfully extubated on [**10-21**]. After discussion\nwith the patient and her family, patient was again taken to OR\nfor palliative aspiration of the brain mass in the attempt to\ndecompress the R temporal region on [**10-28**]. Patient will follow-up\nwith Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital 878**] clinic as an outpatient. She will\ncontinue taking mestinon and decadron at discharge.\n\nCV: During pre-operative workup, patient was found to have had a\nNSTEMI with peak enzymes of 0.53 and CK 146. ECHO showed EF 35%.\nCardiology was consulted and recommended beta blockade\nperi-operatively. Aspirin 325mg was started and held\nperi-operatively; and patient was started on Metoprolol as\ntolerated. Patient tolerated both brain surgeries with flat\ncardiac enzymes. Patient was without chest pain throughout\nhospital course.\n\nID/PULM: Patient spiked a temperature and on [**10-13**], patient\nunderwent bronchoscopy which showed thick secretions. Lavage\nculture grew Serratia marcescens. Patient completed 14 day\ncourse of Ceftazidime for likely pneumonia.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLisinopril 40 mg\nHCTZ 12.5 mg qod\nMestinon 30 mg tid\nValium 2 mg qhs\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
