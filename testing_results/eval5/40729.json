A\nsecond episode occurred upon arrival to the ED. He has\nsubsequently been found to have a right frontal white matter\nbrain lesion and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, most\nconcerning for malignancy. The patient and his wife deny him\never having shown seizure activity including clonus or staring\nspells. He reports being healthy and has not had constitutional\nsymptoms including fevers, rigors, night sweats, or weight loss.\nHe has had no recurrence of seizures and now feels well. We are\nbeing consulted for consideration of a brain biopsy of the right\nfrontal lesion.\n\nPast Medical History:\nHLD\nHypothyroidism\n\n\nSocial History:\nex smoker 20 years ago\n\n\nFamily History:\nNo seizures or cancers\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nGeneral: Awake, NAD, seated in bed comfortably\nHead: NC/AT, no scleral icterus, no oropharyngeal lesions\nNeck: Supple, no nuchal rigidity\nExtremities: Warm, no edema, palpable radial/dorsalis pedis\npulses\nSkin: No rashes or lesions\n\nNeurologic Examination:\n\n- Mental Status - Awake, alert, oriented x 3. Recalls a coherent\nhistory. Registration [**4-6**] and recall [**4-6**]. Concentration\nmaintained when recalling months backwards. Follows two step\ncommands, midline and appendicular. Language fluent with intact\nrepetition and verbal comprehension. Normal prosody. No\nparaphasic errors. High and low frequency naming intact. No\ndysarthria. No apraxia or neglect.\n\n- Cranial Nerves - [II] PERRL 3->2 brisk. VF full to number\ncounting.\n[III, IV, VI] EOMI, no nystagmus. [V] V1-V3 without deficits to\nlight touch bilaterally.\n[VII] No facial asymmetry. [VIII] Hearing intact to finger rub\nbilaterally.\n[IX, X] Palate elevation symmetric. [[**Doctor First Name 81**]] SCM/Trapezius strength\n5/5 bilaterally. [XII] Tongue midline.\n\n- Motor - Normal bulk and tone. No pronation, no drift. No\ntremor\nor asterixis.\n=[Delt] [Bic] [Tri] [ECR] [IO] [IP] [Quad] [Ham] [TA] [Gas]\n[[**Last Name (un) 938**]]\nL  5      5     5     5     5    5    5      5     5    5     5\nR  5      5     5     5     5    5    5      5     5    5     5\n\n- Sensory - No deficits to light touch bilaterally.\n\n- Reflexes\n=[Bic] [Tri] [[**Last Name (un) 1035**]] [Quad] [Gastroc]\nL 2      2      2      2        2\nR 2      2      2      2        2\nPlantar response flexor bilaterally.\n\n- Coordination - No dysmetria with finger/foot mirrored\nmovements.\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nNC CT Head [**8-18**]\n\n1.4-cm hyperdensity in the right frontal lobe with surrounding\nvasogenic edema. This is a nonspecific imaging finding and the\ndifferential diagnosis includes tumor, encephalitis or venous\nischemia. Primary traumatic injury is felt to be much less\nlikely. The imaging findings could be consistent with lymphoma.\n\nMRI Head c/s contrast [**8-19**]\n\nRight frontal signal abnormality with a central portion of\nrestricted diffusion is not typical for an infarction and is\npredominantly\ninvolving the white matter. The restricted diffusion could favor\ninfiltrative lesion with high cellularity such as lymphoma or\nencephalitis.\n\nNC CT Head [**8-30**]\nStatus post open biopsy from a right frontal approach with a\nsmall amount of subarachnoid blood; right frontal sulcal\neffacement and vasogenic edema similar to [**2113-8-18**], head\nCT.\n\nMRI Head c/s contrast [**8-30**]\n1. Right frontal lobe lesion redemonstrated for surgical\nplanning, with faint ill-defined enhancement, surrounded by\nvasogenic edema. Please see the prior MR head study for\nadditional details.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt was admitted to the neurosurgery service and underwent an\nelective right frontal craniotomy for resection of tumor.
