Th largest is a 2\ncm left\nthalamic lesion with mild mass effect on 3rd ventricle. Other\nlesions are\nfound predominantly throughout the cerebral hemispheres at the\n[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white\njunction, along the ventricles, in the cerebellum, and a few in\nthe midbrain.\n\nPFI AUDIT # 1\n\n\nFinal Report\nINDICATION: 49-year-old woman with confusion and altered mental\nstatus,\nhistory of metastatic breast cancer.\n\nCOMPARISON: Head CT [**2197-8-2**]. Brain MR, [**2196-5-2**].\n\nTECHNIQUE: Pre- and post-contrast sequences were obtained\nthrough the brain.\nMP-RAGE sequences could not be obtained due to patient\ndiscomfort.\nDiffusion-weighted sequences were acquired.\n\nBRAIN MRI: Innumerable round, enhancing lesions are present\nthroughout the\nbrain. Many demonstrate increased signal on both T1- and\nT2-weighted\nsequences. Many of these lesions, however, demonstrate only\nminimal to no\nsurrounding edema. The largest lesion is located in the left\nthalamus,\nmeasuring 1.8 x 2.1 cm, which exerts mild mass effect on the\nthird ventricle.\nMost of the lesions are located in the bilateral cerebral\nhemispheres,\npredominantly at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction. Some lesions\nare situated\nalong the subependymal surface along the lateral ventricles. A\nfew smaller\nlesions are present within the subcortical white matter.\nInnumerable\nadditional lesions are present within the cerebellar\nhemispheres. A few\nscattered lesions are noted in the mid brain. Abnormal signal\nwithin the left\nfrontal calvarium indicates a site of bony metastasis, as\nindicated on the\n[**2197-8-2**] head CT.\n\nThere is no intracranial hemorrhage or large mass effect. There\nis no\ninfarction. Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and\nconfiguration. The\nmajor intracranial vascular flow voids are unremarkable. The\nglobes are\nintact, without abnormal enhancement.\n\nIMPRESSIONS: Innumerable enhancing lesions throughout the brain,\nas on the\nprior CT, with relatively little edema or mass effect. Largest\nlesion is a\n2-cm left thalamic lesion with mild mass effect on the third\nventricle. These\nare compatible with metastases, not appreciably changed from the\n[**2197-8-2**]\nhead CT.\n\nThe study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.\n\n\nDR.

[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]\n\n\nFINDINGS:\nABNORMALITY #1: There were bursts and runs lasting up to 45\nseconds at\na time generalized monomorphic delta frequency slowing,\noccasionally\nwith notched features bifrontally.\nABNORMALITY #2: The background was slow and disorganized\nthroughout the\nrecording reaching a maximum frequency of about 5 Hz.\nBACKGROUND: As described above in Abnormality #2.\nHYPERVENTILATION: Was not performed.\nINTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Was not performed.\nSLEEP: No normal sleep morphologies were seen.\nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.\nIMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of\nbursts and\nruns of generalized slowing as well as a slow and disorganized\nbackground. These findings indicate the presence of a moderate\nencephalopathy. Encephalopathies represent non-specific diffuse\ncerebral dysfunction that may be caused by medications,\nmetabolic\ndisturbances, hypoxic ischemic injury, and other etiologies.\n.\nCT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 80213**]\nReason: eval for acute process\n\n\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n   49 year old woman with confusion/AMS, h/o breast CA\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\n   eval for acute process\nCONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:\n   None.\n\n\n\nWet Read: KKgc WED [**2197-8-2**] 4:36 PM\nMultiple hyperdense lesions seen throughout the brain. A large\nlesion in the\nleft thalamus has surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the\nthird\nventricle without hydrocephalus. Basal cisterns are patent, no\nevidence of\nherniation or midline shift. Left frontal lucent lesion are\nconcerning for\nmetastatic disease.\n\n\nFinal Report\nINDICATION: 49-year-old woman with confusion and altered mental\nstatus, has a\nhistory of metastatic breast cancer.\n\nCOMPARISON: MRI of the brain and orbit [**2196-5-3**].\n\nTECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were acquired through the\nhead without\nintravenous contrast. However, the patient has had contrast\nenhanced CT of\nthe torso an hour ago, limiting evaluation for subarachnoid\nbleed.\n\nInnumerable hyperdense lesions are seen diffusely distributed\nthroughout the\ncerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum. The largest of these\nlesions is\npresent within the left thalamus (2:15), measuring 2.3 x 1.8 cm,\ncausing mass\neffect on the third ventricle. Some vasogenic edema is seen\nsurrounding this\nlesion. No shift of midline structures or herniation is\ndetected. Within the\nlimitations of this study, no large extra-axial hematomas are\ndetected. There\nis no hydrocephalus. The ventricles and sulci are normal in\ncaliber and\nconfiguration, except for mild compression of the third\nventricle.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUE: There is a lucent lesion in\nthe left\nfrontal vertex (2:25), which, given additinal findings is\nsuspicious for\nmetastatic disease. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid\nair cells\nare clear.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.

The great vessels are within normal\nlimits. A few\nscattered mediastinal lymph nodes are not significantly changed,\nand not\nenlarged by size criteria, measuring up to 6 mm in the\nparatracheal station.\n\nRedemonstrated are innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules,\nwhich are only\nminimally larger compared to prior study. For example, a nodule\nwithin the\nright upper lobe (2:14) measures 9 mm x 9 mm, previously\nmeasured 8 mm x 8 mm.\nA nodule within the left upper lobe measures 11 mm x 9 mm,\npreviously measured\n10 mm x 8 mm. A nodule within the left lower lobe (2:33)\nmeasures 16 mm x 14\nmm, previously measured 15 mm x 14 mm. No new lesion is\nidentified. There is\nno pleural effusion.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver is infiltrated by\nnumerous\nmetastatic lesions. There is a different enhancement pattern of\nthe lesions\ncompared to prior study, making direct comparison difficult.\nMany of the\nlesions demonstrate low attenuation, compatible with necrosis.\nThough direct\ncomparison is difficult, there is an increase in number of the\nlesions, as\nwell as an increase in size of several of the lesions. For\nexample, a lesion\nwithin the right lobe of the liver (2:51) measures 18-mm,\npreviously measured\napproximately 10 mm. There is also increasing capsular\nretraction of the\nliver. The portal venous system is patent without evidence of\nthrombus. The\ngallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are\nunremarkable.\n\nThe stomach, small bowel, and large bowel are unremarkable.\n\nThere is no free air or free fluid. A few scattered\nretroperitoneal lymph\nnodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria, with the aortocaval\nnodes\nmeasuring up to 5 mm in short axis.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder and\nrectum are\nunremarkable. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Redemonstrated are innumerable sclerotic\nmetastatic\nlesions throughout the thoracolumbar spine, sternum, femurs, and\npelvis, which\nare not significantly changed from prior study. There is no\nevidence for\npathologic fracture.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Innumerable hepatic metastases, which are increased in number\nand slightly\nincreased in size compared to prior study.\n2. Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules, which are also\nminimally larger\nin size, without evidence of new lesions.\n3.

Patient has\nbeen very depressed with confusion at times.Head CT scan showed-\n 1. Innumerable hyperdense lesions distributed throughout the\nbrain with mild mass effect and edema surrounding the largest\nlesion in the left thalamus. Started whole brain radiation in\nhouse, recieved 5 treatments the last being [**8-11**].Did not place\npatient on anti seizure medications because she had no history\nof seizures  and there is no evidence in patients with brain\nmets prophylactic anti seizure meds are benficial.Continued\nDexamethasone 4 mg Q6H IV to decrease intracranial pressure.\nDexamethasone will be tapered per radiation oncology\nrecommendations on discharge.Got Palliative Care consult- which\nfollowed the case,  have decided to start home w/ nursing\nservices and home resources.\nHusband was made the proxy via interpreter [**8-4**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] had seen\nthe patient and recommended EEG which revealed no seizure\nactivity(indicated moderate encephalopathy).

We got a head MRI to better stage her disease\nwhich showed :Innumerable enhancing lesions throughout the\nbrain, as on the\nprior CT, with relatively little edema or mass effect. Largest\nlesion is a 2-cm left thalamic lesion with mild mass effect on\nthe third ventricle. These are compatible with metastases, not\nappreciably changed from the [**2197-8-2**] head CT.\n.\n# Breast Cancer: metastatic, currently on Doxil Cycle # 4 Day #\n30 with zometa.\n-Patient is BRCA1/2 negative.\n- f/u per primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]\n.\n# Right arm and right leg weakness- most likely caused by her\nbrain metastases, especially given large lesion in the left\nthalamus.\n.\n- the weakness is [**5-8**] power in the right upper and lower\nextremities\ncompared to the left which is [**6-7**] power.
