There is an extensive enhancement\nidentified in the mass. The location and the appearance of the\nmass are suggestive of a glioma or less likely a lymphoma.\nAdditionally, there is enhancement seen in the left frontal\nsulci as well as in the basal cisterns and internal auditory\ncanals indicative of leptomeningeal spread of the neoplasm.\nThere is mass effect on the anterior horns of both lateral\nventricles. A prominent flow voids are identified adjacent to\nthe inferior aspect of the neoplasm indicative of hypertrophic\nblood vessels or draining veins.\n\nIMPRESSION: Large bifrontal neoplasm extending through the\ncorpus callosum\nlikely a primary neoplasm such as glioma or lymphoma.\nHypertrophic vessels\nare visualized in the inferior aspect of the tumor, indicating\nvascular supply and whatever the diagnosis of glioma.\nLeptomeningeal extension of the neoplasm is identified through\nthe basal ganglia and internal auditory canal.\n\nCT Torso [**2152-6-24**]:\nFINDINGS:\nCHEST: There are no pathologically enlarged thoracic lymph\nnodes. There is\nno pericardial or pleural effusion. There is mild dilatation of\nthe\nesophagus. Lung windows demonstrate no nodules or masses. The\ncentral\nairways are patent, without endobronchial lesions. There are no\nsuspicious\nosseous lesions.\n\nABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas,\nand\ngallbladder are normal. There are no pathologically enlarged\nlymph nodes.\nThere is an umbilical hernia containing fat and small bowel,\nwithout evidence of obstruction. There is no free fluid in the\nabdomen. Delayed images demonstrate normal contrast excretion of\nthe kidneys bilaterally.\n\nPELVIS: The bladder is decompressed with a Foley catheter. The\npelvic bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no free fluid.\nThere are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.\n\nBone windows demonstrate a lytic lesion in the posterior left\niliac bone with a thick sclerotic border. No other focal lesions\nare identified. There are minimal degenerative changes of the\nspine.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of mass in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.\n2. Umbilical hernia containing fat and small bowel.\n3. Nonaggressive-appearing lesion within the posterior left\niliac bone,\nunlikely to represent a metastatic lesion.\n4. Mild esophageal dilatation.\n\nCT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2152-6-25**]:\nFINDINGS: Again noted is extensive hypodensity involving both\nfrontal lobes and the genu of the corpus callosum. There is\npersistent mass effect on the bilateral frontal horns. Allowing\nfor differences in slice selection, there may be slight interval\nincrease in the diameter of the lateral ventricles. The left\nlateral ventricle measures 14 mm compared to 10 mm previously\nand the right lateral ventricle measures 14 mm compared to 12 mm\npreviously. There is no shift of normally midline structures or\nevidence of uncal or transtentorial herniation. The 3rd and 4th\nventricles are preserved. There is no evidence of hemorrhagic\nconversion. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is otherwise\npreserved without evidence of infarction. The visualized portion\nof the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.\nNo osseous abnormality is identified.\n\nIMPRESSION: Extensive hypodense lesion in the bilateral frontal\nlobes with\nslight interval increase in the diameter of the lateral\nventricles. Third and fourth ventricles remain patent and\nbasilar cisterns preserved.\n\nPathology Examination from steriotactic biopsy [**2152-6-26**]:\nDIAGNOSIS:\n1.  Brain, target point, stereotactic biopsy (A):\nGlioblastoma multiforme, (WHO Grade IV); See note.\n2.  Brain, -4, stereotactic biopsy (B):\nGlioblastoma multiforme, (WHO Grade IV); See note.\n3.  Brain -8, stereotactic biopsy (C):\nGlioblastoma multiforme, (WHO Grade IV); See note.\n4.  Brain, -12, stereotactic biopsy (D):\nWhite matter infiltrated by glioma.\n5.  Brain, -16, stereotactic biopsy (E):\nWhite matter with reactive gliosis and rare atypical cells.\n6.  Brain, -20, stereotactic biopsy (F):\nWhite matter with reactive gliosis and rare atypical cells.\n\nNote:  The tumor displays hypercellularity, vascular\nproliferation, necrosis, and mitotic figures.\n\nGross:\nThe specimen is received in the O.R. in 11 parts, all labeled\nwith the patient's name, \"[**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname **]\"  and the medical record\nnumber. Each part consists of a 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm fragment of\nwhite soft tissue, except for the target point.\n\nPart 1 is additionally labeled \"target point\" and measures 0.6\ncm x 0.1 cm and is red in color. It is entirely submitted in\ncassette A.\n\nPart 2 is additionally labeled \"-2\" and is consumed entirely by\nintraoperative smear diagnosis. Smear diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**]\nis: \"Malignant glioma\".\n\nPart 3 additionally labeled \"-4\", and is entirely submitted in\ncassette B.\n\nPart 4 is additionally labeled \"-6\", and is consumed entirely by\nintraoperative smear diagnosis. Smear diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**]\nis: \"Malignant glioma\".\n\nPart 5 additionally labeled \"-8\", and is entirely submitted in\ncassette C.\n\nPart 6 is additionally labeled \"-10\", and is consumed entirely\nby intraoperative smear diagnosis. Smear diagnosis by Dr.\n[**First Name (STitle) 4223**] is: \"Malignant glioma\".\n\nPart 7 is additionally labeled \"-12\", and is entirely submitted\nin cassette D.\n\nPart 8 is additionally labeled \"-14\" and is consumed entirely by\nintraoperative smear diagnosis. Smear diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**]\nis: \"White matter with reactive gliosis and rare atypical\ncells\".\n\nPart 9 is additionally labeled \"-16\", and is entirely submitted\nin cassette E.\n\nPart 10 is additionally labeled \"-18\", and is consumed entirely\nby intraoperative smear diagnosis. Smear diagnosis by Dr.\n[**First Name (STitle) 4223**] is: \"Reactive gliosis with scattered atypical cells\".\n\nPart 11 is additionally labeled \"-20\", and is entirely submitted\nin cassette F.\n\nCT Head without contrast post-op [**2152-6-26**]:\nFINDINGS: There is a new left frontal burr hole for stereotactic\nbiopsy.\nThere is a small focus of new hemorrhage along the biopsy path\nin the left\nfrontal lobe (2:18). Extensive vasogenic edema is again seen in\nassociation with the known mass involving both frontal lobes and\nthe genu of corpus callosum, with unchanged mass effect on the\nfrontal horns of the\nlateral ventricles. Overall, the ventricles are stable in size.\nMild\nrightward shift of the anterior falx is stable.\n\nThere is a large mucus retention cyst in the right maxillary\nsinus and a\npossible polyp in the left nasal cavity, as before.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nSmall amount of blood along the left frontal biopsy path. No\nchange in mass effect from the bifrontal mass.\n\nMRI Head ([**2152-6-29**])\nFINDINGS: Study is slightly limited due to patient motion during\nexamination.\n\nAgain demonstrated is a heterogeneous mass located within\nbilateral frontal lobes, and crossing the corpus callosum,\ncompatible with biopsy proven glioblastoma multiforme. This mass\nmeasures grossly 6.5 cm x 4.6 cm, with central areas of\nsusceptibility, particularly within the left frontal region,\nlikely reflecting intratumoral hemorrhagic products from recent\nbiopsy. The mass is situated in the expected location of the A2\nsegments of the anterior cerebral arteries, which are not\nclearly visualized.\n\nThere is associated significant vasogenic edema of bilateral\nfrontal lobes. Significant mass effect on the adjacent frontal\nhorns of the lateral ventricles and a rightward shift of\nnormally midline structures by\napproximately 7 mm are not significantly changed.\n\nIncreased FLAIR signal and enhancement surrounding the left\nlateral ventricular ependymal surface is noted. Abnormal\nenhancement is also evident within the basal cisterns and in the\nregion of the thalamus/tectal junction. These findings suggest\nsubarachnoid spread of tumor with a\ndifferential diagnosis of infection, if clinically appropriate.\n\nNo other foci of hemorrhage are identified. There is no infarct,\nwithout\nevidence of diffusion-weighted abnormality. Mucus-retention cyst\nin the right maxillary sinus with mucosal thickening of the\nethmoid sinuses is noted.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Large butterfly glioma in the frontal lobes, compatible with\nknown\nglioblastoma multiforme, with associated significant mass effect\nand vasogenic edema, unchanged.\n\n2. Post-biopsy changes, including a small amount of intratumoral\nhemorrhage.\n\n3. Abnormal enhancement of the left lateral ventricular\nependymal surface, in the basal cisterns, and in the\nthalamo-tectal junction. These findings could indicate\nsubarachnoid spread of tumor. However, a concomitant infection\ncould have a similar appearance and needs clinical correlation .\nAn MRI of the spine is recommended to assess for leptomeningeal\ninvolvement of the spinal axis.\n\n4. Incomplete visualization of the A2 segments of the anterior\ncerebral arteries. A dedicated MRA or CTA is recommended to\nassess for vascular patency.\n\nCT head ([**2152-6-30**])\n\nFINDINGS: Again demonstrated is a large bifrontal mass,\ncompatible with\nbiopsy-proven GBM, with significant mass effect on the adjacent\nfrontal horns of the lateral ventricles and rightward shift of\nmidline by approximately 7 mm. Surrounding low attenuation in\nbilateral frontal lobes is compatible with vasogenic edema, with\na track of high density in the left frontal lobe compatible with\npost-biopsy hemorrhagic tract. These findings are not\nsignificantly changed from the prior study. The size of the\nventricular system is stable, without evidence of new\nhydrocephalus. There are no other foci of intracranial\nhemorrhage. No major vascular territorial infarction is\nidentified. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells\nare normally aerated. Osseous structures reveal biopsy burr hole\nin the left frontal bone.\n\nIMPRESSION: No significant change in large bifrontal mass,\ncompatible with\nbiopsy-proven GBM, and associated significant mass effect on the\nadjacent lateral ventricles and rightward shift of midline.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks\nafter he was found to have a very large bifrontal brain mass.\nHe had been given 1 dose of steroids at the outside hospital but\nthey were not continued here in anticipation of a steriotactic\nbrain biopsy.  The patient had a CT torso that did not show\nevidence of metastatic disease. On [**2152-6-25**] his neurological\nexamination changed and he was unable to speak.  A stat head CT\nshowed increased edema in the frontal region.  At that time he\nwas started on steroids due to his worsening examination and\nincreased edema. Afterwards, he improved significantly and was\noriented x 3 and following commands.\n\nOn [**2152-6-26**], the patient had a steriotactic brain biopsy.  The\npathology revealed that the mass was a glioblastoma WHO Grade\nIV.  Post-operatively the CT scan showed a new small hemorrhage\nat the surgical bed.  He was transferred back to the ICU still\nintubated.  The patient was started on mannitol.\n\nOn [**2152-6-27**], the patient was extubated and his neurological\nexamination was improved.  His mannitol and steroids were weaned\nand he was transferred to the neuro step-down unit.  He\ncontinued to be stable as the weaning of both mannitol and\nsteroids continued and was transferred out of step-down to the\nfloor on [**2152-6-28**].  In the afternoon of [**2152-6-29**] (after\nradiation planning appointment), he was found to have\nsignificant aniscoria (right greater than left) and sixth\ncranial nerve palsy.  Head CT was repeated; and found to have\nsignificantly worsened edema.  He was given a one time dose of\nmannitol 50 gm, re-loaded with Decadron 10 mg, and continued on\nDecadron 4 mg every 6 hours.  Given his marked neurological\ndecline, palliative care was again urgently consulted to assist\nwith appropriate planning.  At this time, the family changed his\ncode status to include no cardiac compressions, defibrillation,\nor CPR; they agree to chemical code only.  In subsequent hours,\nhis neurological examination significantly improved to the point\nthat he could possibly be discharged.  In the setting of his\nprogressive decline, and sensitivity to increasd steroids,\nemergent whole brain radiation was sought.  Pursuant to this\nplan, he was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] [**Hospital1 **]\nunder the Neuro-Oncology Service on [**2152-7-2**] to make\narrangements for this to occur.\n\nFrom [**2152-7-3**] to [**2152-7-7**], he received 5 of 22 total treatments\nof whole brain radiation.  He also began temozolomide while\nin-house.  He was started on Bactrim prophylaxis since he was on\nboth radiation and temozolomide.  His neurological examination\nremained stable during this time with mild right greater than\nleft anisicoria (1 mm difference), with brisk pupillary\nreflexes.  He remained oriented x 2 (difficulty with date) and\nwith 1/3 recall after 5 minutes.  He had poor attention and poor\ncomprehension of his disease.\n\nHe was discharged on Decadron 4 mg every 6 hours, with proton\npump inhibitor, bowel regimen, and instructions to ambulate\nfrequently in an attempt to prevent DVT.  He was also discharged\non [**Month/Day/Year 13401**].  He is scheduled for follow-up on [**2152-7-10**].\n\nMedications on Admission:\nALBUTEROL SULFATE 90 mcg HFA Aerosol Inhaler - 2 puffs Q4 prn\nFLUTICASONE 50 mcg Spray 2 sprays each nostril QD\nFlovent 110 mcg 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **]; HCTZ\nLisinopril 1 QD; Simivastatin; ASPIRIN - 81 mg QD\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
