A fever was noted at that\ntime to be as high as 103.  The headache at that time began to\nget progressively worse in intensity.  The patient was\nreportedly\nseen at an OSH where a CT scan was negative.  The fever and\nheadache continued.  2 days prior to admission the patients\nfamily members noted that she was very weak and unstaedy on her\nfeet, requiring assistance with daily tasks.  At that point the\npatient was no longer sleeping due to the intensity of the pain.\nOn the day of admission the patient was barely walking and at\nthat point the family noted that her eyes started jumping and\nshe\ncouldn't look to her right.  At that point the patient came in\nto\nthe ED.\n  The family notes taht [**Known firstname **] originally had problems swallowing\nand had sores in her mouth for over a month before the fever\nbegan.  They also note that while the patient did have headaches\noff and on over the last few months they were never as intense.\n[**Known firstname **] has no recent travel although she was living in [**Country 4574**]\nuntil [**2099**].  Her cousin notes that she had always been well as\nchild.  They also note that she works as a nurse and takes care\nof many sick people including a child with a chronic illness.\nThey are unaware of any particular illness that she may have\nbeen\nin contact with.\n  Upon arrival the patient was noted to have altered mental\nstatus with leftward eye deviation with nystagmus. A CT showed\nedema. The CSF showed highly elevated protein and WBC. An MRI\nwas\ndone showing FLAIR signal\nhyperintensity and patchy enhancement involving the right\nthalamus, mid brain, splenium of the corpus callosum,\ninferomedial temporal lobe and right cerebellum with associated\nleptomeningeal enhancement in the right cerebellum.  Broad\nspectrum antibiotics were begun at that time and the patient was\nsent to the ICU. In the ICU CT scans showed improvement of the\nedema.  Patient was transferred to step down.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nnone\n\n\nSocial History:\nFrom [**Country 4574**], in US for 16 years, works as NP, married, 1\nchild, denies alcohol, tobbaco or illicit drug use\n\n\nFamily History:\nFather died in an accident; mother is [**Name2 (NI) 54843**]; siblings are\nhealthy\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nGen: patient lying in bed, opens eyes to verbal and tactile\nstimulation.\nHEENT:MMM, no adenopathy,positive Brudzinski,\nCV: NL S1/S2, RRR\nLungs: CTA b/l\nNeuro:Mental Status: patient is lethargic and drowsy, arrousable\nto stimulation, patient will follow commands, opens eyes,\nresponds to questions, oriented to month and year,\nCN: left [**Hospital1 **] eye deviation, right beat nystagmus, pupils 2 mm,\nminimally reactive, left facial droop, corneal reflexes intact,\nMotor: left arm weakness, strength 2/5 in [**Hospital1 **] and tri, moves\nlower\nextremities to command but does not cooperate for strength exam,\nleft up going toe.\nSensory: unable to evaluate.\nCb: unable to test due to mental status.\n\nDISCHARGE EXAM:\nMental status intact, knows [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] backwards easily.

FLAIR signal hyperintensity and patchy enhancement involving\nthe right\nthalamus, mid brain, splenium of the corpus callosum,\ninferomedial temporal lobe and right cerebellum with associated\nleptomeningeal enhancement in the right cerebellum. These\nfindings may reflect an encephalitis of viral, bacterial or\nfungal etiology versus ADEM. Given the time course of\npresentation of symptoms, lymphoma or a glial neoplasm is\nthought to be less likely.\n\n2. Punctate foci of restricted diffusion within the right\nthalamus, most\nlikely caused by a secondary vasculitis causing punctate foci of\ninfarction\nsecondary to surrounding inflammatory process.\n\n3. Normal MRV without evidence of venous sinus thrombosis.\n\nMRI [**2120-7-16**]:\nMild interval decrease in enhancement within the splenium of the\ncorpus\ncallosum and right cerebellum with slightly increased prominence\nof\nenhancement in the right thalamus, with unchanged persistent\nFLAIR signal\nabnormalities within the right thalamus, mid brain, medial\ntemporal lobe, and cerebellar hemisphere compared to the prior\nstudy. Unchanged foci of slow diffusion are again demonstrated.\nThese findings remain nonspecific in appearance. Findings may\nreflect encephalitis, with a viral etiology favored, including\nentities such as Eastern equine encephalitis. Mycobacterial,\ntypical bacterial and fungal etiologies are thought to be less\nlikely. Differential diagnoses also includes neoplasms such as\nglioma and inflammatory etiologies such as vasculitis.\n\nCT CHEST/AB/PELV\n1. No intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, or intra-pelvic mass or\nlymphadenopathy\ndetected.\n2. Enlarged uterus, with slight heterogenous enhancement of the\nmyometrium.\nFindings could represent adenomyosis and/or intramural fibroids,\nbut CT is\nlimited in its ability to evaluate the uterus and therefore\npelvic ultrasound\nis recommended for further evaluation if clinically indicated.\n3. Pulmonary nodular density adjacent to the left major fissure\nis unchanged\nfrom [**2119-5-22**].\n\nDISCHARGE LABS:\n[**2120-7-22**] 09:37AM BLOOD WBC-9.5 RBC-4.31 Hgb-11.9* Hct-37.1\nMCV-86 MCH-27.6 MCHC-32.0 RDW-16.3* Plt Ct-340\n[**2120-7-22**] 09:37AM BLOOD Glucose-178* UreaN-12 Creat-0.7 Na-137\nK-3.7 Cl-100 HCO3-24 AnGap-17\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n  Upon arrival the patient was noted to have altered mental\nstatus with leftward eye deviation with nystagmus. A CT showed\nedema. The CSF showed highly elevated protein and WBC. An MRI\nwas\ndone showing FLAIR signal hyperintensity and patchy enhancement\ninvolving the right\nthalamus, mid brain, splenium of the corpus callosum,\ninferomedial temporal lobe and right cerebellum with associated\nleptomeningeal enhancement in the right cerebellum.  Broad\nspectrum antibiotics were begun at that time and the patient was\nsent to the ICU.\n\nICU:\n# Neuro:\nPatient was admitted with headache, fever and altered mental\nstatus. There was initially a broad differential that included\nbrain abscess and meningoencephalitis. Head CT and MRI showed\nmultiple FLAIR and enhancing hyperintensities throughout the\nbrain (R thalamus, corpus callosum, midbrain). LP was extremely\nsignificant for WBC 1150.\nID was consulted. Patient was started on vancomycin, CTX,\nampicillin, and acyclovir. Numerous bacterial, viral, parasitic\nand fungal studies were sent from blood and CSF. PPD was placed\nand was negative. HIV was negative.\nPatient continued to wax and wane, and remained somnolent on\nexam. She was started on mannitol, which did not improve her\nexam very much, it was stopped [**7-11**] for increasing sodium\nlevels.\nID recommended treating empirically for TB and mycoplasma. All\nother empiric antibiotics and antivirals were discontinued once\ncultures were negative for 48 hours and HSV PCR was negative.\nPatient was started on RIPE and moxifloxacin. They also\nrecommended dexamethasone to treat the inflammation that could\nbe associated with TB meningoencephalitis. Consecutive CT scans\nshowed improvement of cerebral edema.\n\nStep Down:\nNeuro:\nPatient's mental status began to improve significantly after\ndecadron was started on [**7-9**].  Since that time the patient is\nmore awake and alert. A repeat LP showed stable pleocytosis but\nno improvement. An extremely extensive workup was pursued for\ninfectious and inflammatory causes in the serum and CSF. All of\nthese studies were negative. CT of the torso was done to look\nfor underlying malignancy, and was negative. There was no sign\nof intrapulmonary TB. Opthomology performed an eye exam to look\nfor tubercles which would suggest TB and/or malignant cells in\nthe vitreous representing lymphoma.  The eye exam was normal.\nWe continued to treat the patient empirically with\ndexamethasone, RIPE and moxifloxicin. She continued to improve\nin terms of neurologic exam. Her left sided weakness improved\nsignificantly, however she continued to have neglect of that\nside making activity difficult for her. At discharge, her gaze\npreference and skew deviation was improved, and nystagmus was\nminimal. Her left facial droop was mild compared to initial\nexam. Motor strength was 5- in left deltoid, tricep, wrist and\nfinger extensors and IP, otherwise full strength.\nRepeat LP showed significant improvement in pleocytosis at this\npoint. MRI on day of discharge showed decreased inflammation and\ndecreased size and intensity of the prior lesions, although\nradiology read is still pending.\nBrain biopsy was considered at several points, however it was\nfelt that the patient was improving clinically and the biopsy\nwould not be without risks. It was determined that we would\ncontinue to treat empirically for possible TB\nmeningoencephalitis and monitor clinical and radiologic status.\nShe will continue on dexamethasone at current dose. She will\nbegin to taper the steroids in 1 week. If she continues to\nimprove with steroid taper, we will not plan on biopsy. However,\nif she does not continue to improve in the following 4-6 weeks\non current regimen, we will discuss with neurosurgery and pursue\na biopsy.\n\nShe passsed speech and swallow bedside evaluation. She began to\nwork with PT/OT but requires significant reconditioning and\nteaching to improve her left neglect and motor planning. She\nwill be discharged to [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 24759**] [**Hospital1 656**] acute rehab.\n\nPatient will follow up with neurology in 4 weeks. She will\nfollow up with ID in 3 weeks. She will continue current abx\nincluding RIPE and moxifloxacin. She will taper steroids in 1\nweek, with a 4 week taper. She will get monthly safety labs\nfaxed to ID office.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nmotrin/tylenol; started on azythromycin for 01 day\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
