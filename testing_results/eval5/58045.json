Tumor cells are\n\n          Positive for:  c-Kit\n\n          Negative for: Cytokeratin cocktail, CD30 (immunoblasts\nonly), S100 (macrophages only), AFP, and PLAP (however, no\ninternal control).\n\n          An LCA will be reported in an addendum.\n\nADDENDUM: A stain for LCA is negative (small lymphocytes only).\n\nAddendum added by: DR.

The peripheral smear was done on\nthe specimen.  Peripheral smear diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is\n\"sclerotic tissue with small lymphocytes, likely reactive.\"  The\nspecimen was entirely submitted in A.\n\n\n\nPart 2 is additionally labeled \"retroperitoneal mass, left\nfrozen section #2.\" It consists of red tan multiple soft tissue\nfragments measuring 1 x 1 x 0.4 cm in aggregate.  The surface of\none of the fragments is smooth and probably has peritoneum.\nFrozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is \"poorly differentiated\nepithelioid neoplasm plus adjacent reactive/fibrotic tissue.\nInsufficient for diagnosis.\"  Frozen section remnant is\nsubmitted in B, the remainder is submitted in C.\n\n\n\nPart 3 is additionally labeled \"retroperitoneal mass biopsy #3.\"\nIt consists of red tan soft tissue fragments measuring 0.9 x 0.4\nx 0.2 cm.
