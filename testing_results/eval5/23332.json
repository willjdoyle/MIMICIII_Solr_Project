Bronchoscopy and\nmediastinoscopy for lymph node biopsy performed on [**12-10**] revealed\na poorly differentiated carcinoma on staining, most consistent\nwith a lung large cell malignancy, with invasion of the large\nvessels.  Staging PET scan showed extensive disseminated\nFDG-avid disease throughout the\nneck, chest, abdomen and pelvis.  Head MRI showed multiple tiny\nring-enhancing lesions throughout the supra and infratentorial\ncompartments highly\nsuspicious for metastatic disease.  Patient admitted [**2140-1-8**] with\nbilateral malignant pleural effusions that repeatedly recurred\npost-thoracentesis.  He underwent talc pleurodesis and was\ndischarged on [**2140-1-26**] to [**Hospital1 **].\nHe was given cycle #1 of carboplatin/taxol with the plan to get\ncyle #2 in 3 weeks followed by whole brain radiation.\n.\nHe was sent from [**Hospital1 **] today for obtundation, hypotension,\nand tachycardia with complaint of shortness of breath and per\nreport, with low grade fevers.  On arrival to the ED, vital\nsigns temp 93.9, BP 92/70, HR 132, RR 32.  BP dropped to 64/20,\ncordis placed into his right femoral vein, given total of 4L NS,\nstarted on Levophed, seen by cardiology who performed a bedside\nechocardiogram which showed no evidence of RA/RV collapse.\nPatient's breathing appeared labored and he was reportedly more\nconfused with ABG of 7.26/45/131, patient was intubated for\nrespiratory distress, acidosis and airway protection with his\nworsening mental status.\nCXR showed pulmonary edema.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.

Additional\natelectasis within the lingula.\n3) Stable mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.\n4) Emphysematous changes and diffuse intralobular septal\nthickening and nodularity, suggestive of lymphangitic spread of\ntumor.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n56 year-old male with metastatic large cell lung cancer, h/o\npericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis and window,\nmalignant pleural effusion s/p talc pleurodesis, pulmonary\nembolus, now presents with altered mental status, respiratory\ndistress, and hypotension.\n\nPatient was intubated (as noted), started on levophed to\nmaintain blood pressure, however, and patient was thought to be\nin sepsis with respiratory compromise from recurrent pleural\neffusion.  Patient was found to have enlarged right pleural\neffusion, with stable left, and pulsus paradoxicus of 10\n(similar to last admission).  In addition, patient had\nintermittent episodes of tachycardia to 190s, thought to be\nsecondary to myocardial irritability as a result of residual\nmalignant pericardial effusion.\n\nPlans were made to aggressively treat patient including\ndiagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis and aggressive volume\nresuscitation for presumed sepsis.  However, given his\nprogressive and rapid clinical decline (including now\nlymphangitic spread of NSCLC) despite chemotherapy, a discussion\nwas held between the patient's primary oncology fellow and the\npatient's family with regard to goals of care.  Therefore, the\ndecision was made on hospital day two to withdraw care and\nextubate the patient.  Patient was given morphine for comfort\nfollowing extubation, and expired 20 minutes following\nwithdrawal of ventilation and blood pressure support.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nspironolactone 25mg PO once daily\nmetoprolol 50mg PO BID\nLasix 40mg PO once daily\nKlonopin 0.5mg PO BID\nAtrovent nebs prn\nalbuterol nebs prn\nlorazepam 1mg Q6H PRN\nlactulose 20mg PO once daily\nLovenox 100mg SC BID\nAmbien 5mg PO QHS\nsenna\ncolace\nAPAP\nphenergan prn\noxycodone prn\n\nDischarge Medications:\nN/A\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nStage IV large cell lung cancer\nProbable Bacterial Sepsis\nMalignant pleural effusions\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nn/a\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nn/a\n\n\n",
