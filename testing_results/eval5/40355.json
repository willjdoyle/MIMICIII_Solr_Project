Lesions are consistent with metastases. No\nevidence of transependymal signal change to suggest acute\nhydrocephalus.\n\nCT brain [**7-17**] -\n1. Status post left occipital craniectomy for resection of left\ncerebellar\nmass. There is expected pneumocephalus and post-surgical change,\nas well as a 1.5 x 2.6 cm post-operative hematoma in the\nresection bed. Continued close imaging followup is warranted.\n\n2. Stable appearance of necrotic mass in the left\ntemporoparietal region,\nwith local mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle and no\nsignificant\nshift of midline structures.\n\nMR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2116-7-19**]\n The patient is status post left occipital tumor resection in\nthe left\ncerebellar hemisphere, the expected surgical changes are\nvisualized consistent with blood products and air in the\nsurgical cavity, this lesion has been decreased in size since\nthe prior study and the surgical bed is filling with blood\nproducts and CSF. Supratentorially the cystic necrotic mass\nlesion is redemonstrated with internal nodularity and\nenhancement, relatively unchanged since the prior study. No new\nmetastatic lesions are visualized since the most recent\nexamination.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt was admitted to the ICU for close neuromonitoring.  A brain\nMRI obtained on [**7-17**] demonstrated enhaninc cystic lesion in the\nleft cerbellar region and left temporal region consistent with\nmetastasis.  Surgical itervention was recommend and on [**7-17**], he\nwas taken to the OR where under general anesthesia he underwent\nposterior fossa craniectomy resection of tumor. He tolerated\nthis procedure well and was extubated without incident.  He\nreturned to ICU in stable condition.  A post-op CT demonstrated\npost-operative changes with hyperintensity in the surgical bed\nlikely surgical material and mild hemorrhage.\n\nHis ICU course was uncomplicated. He was started on subcutaneous\nheparin and MRI was done. Dilantin level was 9.8. MRI showed\nreduced size of lesion with blood in surgical bed, no new\nmetastatic lesion were seen. Patient was transferred to the\nfloor.\n\nOn [**7-20**], patient was nonfocal on examination, PT cleared him for\nhome and he was discharged to follow up in brain tumor clinic on\nthe [**4-26**].\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nenalapril, omeprazole, trazodone,ambien, multiple inhalers\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. dexamethasone 2 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO twice a day.\nDisp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n2.
