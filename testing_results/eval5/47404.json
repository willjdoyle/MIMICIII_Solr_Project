In\nED, she was found to have guaiac + black stool with HCT =19. She\nreceived FFP,PRBC and Vit K. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for\nfurther evaluation after a head CT revealed \"diffuse lesions.\"\nOn arrival she was HD stable, but had one episode of frank\nmelena. She was transfused with 4 FFP, 2 PRBC, and Proplex\n(factor 9) and admitted to the MICU for observation. She\nremained HD stable overnight without further melena. A repeat\nnon-contrast head CT was done, which was c/w new metastatic\nlesions. Today neurosurgery and radiation oncology both\nrecommended MRI to further characterize lesions give h/o\nmultiple emboli.\nCurrently she has no complaints. States no f/c/cough/sob/chest\npain/abd pain/n/v/dysuria.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.  Small cell lung CA diagnosed [**10-28**] during admission for\ncough/fatigue/wt loss.

Mother - died of stomach CA\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nPE: 97.9, 140/70, 98, 140/70, 97% RA\ngen: well appearing, pleasant, responds to questions\nappropriately\nheent: mmm, OC clear, neck supple\nlungs: scattered rhonchi with wheeze, poor air movement\nthroughout\ncv: rrr, no m\nabd: soft, thin, nt\next: w/wp, no edema\nneuro: A+O x 3, CN II - XII intact, motor strength symmetric [**5-29**]\nall extremities, no Babinski, poor finger to nose/rapid\nalternating movement\n\nPertinent Results:\nCT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No intracranial hemorrhage is\nidentified. Within the right and left cerebellar hemispheres,\nthere are two foci of increased density, which are well\ncircumscribed, and likely represent metastatic foci. These\nmeasure approximately 12 mm on the right and 10 mm within the\nleft cerebellar hemisphere. Additionally, there is a third\nlesion within the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe,\nwhich measures approximately 12 mm. This lesion demonstrates\nsurrounding decreased attenuation, consistent with edema. The\nventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift of normally\nmidline structures. Within the occipital lobes bilaterally,\nthere is focal encephalomalacia from prior infarct. The\n[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The soft tissue\nand osseous structures are normal. No lytic or sclerotic lesions\nare identified within the visualized osseous structures.\nIMPRESSION: Three new foci are seen within the cerebellar\nhemispheres and the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe.\nThese are consistent with new metastatic foci, which were not\npreviously seen on the prior study. No intracranial hemorrhage\nis identified. Results were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 714**]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 11:50 a.m. on [**2200-6-11**].\n\nAdmission labs:\n[**2200-6-10**] 09:45PM   GLUCOSE-135* UREA N-28* CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-139\nPOTASSIUM-4.7 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-27 ANION GAP-13\n[**2200-6-10**] 09:45PM   PT-34.7* PTT-52.3* INR(PT)-8.0\n[**2200-6-10**] 09:45PM   WBC-12.2*# RBC-2.23*# HGB-7.1*# HCT-21.1*#\nMCV-95 MCH-32.1* MCHC-33.9 RDW-16.0*\n[**2200-6-10**] 09:45PM   NEUTS-80* BANDS-1 LYMPHS-12* MONOS-5 EOS-2\nBASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nA/P: 69 yo female with small cell lung ca, h/o embolic CVA,\nadmitted with melena in setting of supratherapeutic INR, as well\nas new brain metastases\n\n1. New brain lesions\n\nShe has a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer, and was\nfound\non CT to have potential new brain metastases. This was confirmed\nby MRI,\nwhich demonstrated 4 brain metastases with edema, but no mass\neffect.\nShe was started on treatment dose of decadron. Radiation\nOncology was consulted,\nbut ultimately, the patient decided against any further\ntreatment including brain\nirradiation. Her goals of care and code status were discussed\nduring this admission, and - in light of this evidence of her\nfurther progressed disease - she and her family decided together\nthat she is DNR/DNI, and that she wants no further\ninvasive/aggressive treatment. Specifically, no further\nchemotherapy, radiation therapy, or any other aggressive\ntreatment. She will be d/c to rehab for further care.\n\n2. GIB\n\nShe has a history of GI bleeding in the setting of cecal ulcers\nand AVM.\nShe presented with significant GI bleeding with Hct of 19 in the\ncontext\nof supratherapeutic INR of 11. She was managed in the ICU with\nVit K, FFP,\nand supportive blood transfusions. She thereafter remained\nhemodynamically stable,\nhad no further GI bleeding, and her Hct remained stable.\n\nThe risks of recurrent embolic stroke were outweighed by the\nbenefit of\nholding her coumadin in the setting of active GI bleeding and\nnew hemorrhagic\nbrain metastases. Her INR trended down from 11 to 1.2 after\nholding coumadin,\ngiving vit K and FFP.  She will have no further anticoagulation.\n\n3. SCLCA\nNo plan for further chemotherapy/radiation as above.\n\n4.
