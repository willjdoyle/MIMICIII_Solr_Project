Pt has been a bit fatigued\nsince his chemotherapy was started, but had no seizure-like\nactivity prior to yesterday, when his brother noted that his R\nhand would shake intermittently. He didn't make much of it,\nhowever, particularly as the pt's mental status seemed baseline.\nThis afternoon, the patient was at home and suddenly developed\ndiffuse R body rhythmic jerking. He seemed lucid to his brother\nbut was unable to produce speech, although he seemed to follow\nsimple commands. No LOC or loss of continence, no tongue biting.\nHe was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.\n\nOf note, his brother has noticed that over the past 2-3 weeks\nthe patient has been more forgetful and overall less \"sharp,\"\noften forgetting words, having trouble naming simple objects and\noften losing his train of thought. These changes were somewhat\nignored b/c they were thought ot be due to the chemotherapy.\nOverall, otherwise, pt has been relatively well with no\nintercurrent infections or illness.\n\nPast Medical History:\nHTN\nPTSD\ndepression\nplantar warts\ngenital herpes\nGERD\nduodenal ulcer H pylori negative\n\nSocial History:\nNo tobacco now or in past.

There are\nno new mass lesions.\nAlthough the full multivoxel spectroscopy results are not\navailable, the single- voxel spectroscopy results demonstrate a\ndecreased NAA peak, but elevated choline, lactate/lipid, and\nmyoinositol peaks suggestive of a malignant tumor\n\nCT ABD/PELVIS\n1) Trace ascites.\n2) Stable appearance of upper abdomen with no evidence of\nrecurrent disease.\n3) Stable peripancreatic fat stranding and small lymph nodes.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n59 year old male with pancreatic cancer, presents in with right\nsided arm and leg twitching c/w with partial status. Found to\nhave left frontal lobe mass.  He was initially admitted to the\nICU for ativan and EEG monitoring.\n\n1. Neuro:\nHe was initially given ativan and loaded with dilantin for\nseizure control.  He was started on IV decadron, 10mg IV, then\n6mg q 4h.  His seizures became less frequent and resolved\ncompletely by hospital day #3.  He was transfered to the\nneurology floor on [**4-5**] where he was started on Keppra.  He has\nslowly been transitioned from dilantin to Keppra without\nrecurrence of his seizures.  At time of discharge, his dilantin\nwas tapered to 100mg qd which he will continue for two days,\nthen discontinue.  He will continue on Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]. His\nsteroids were also slowly tapered of the course of his\nadmission.  He was on Decadron, which is currently 6mg po q 6\nhours.  Will taper to 6mg po q 8h on discharge.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of left frontal mass included metastasis,\nprimary brain tumor, infection or stroke.  Imaging seems most\nconsistent with a primary CNS lesion such as glioma, PNET, or\nlymphoma.  MRS [**Last Name (STitle) **] done to better evaluate etiology of this\nlesion.  MRS [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 23765**] with tumor.  The patient refused LP\nto look for malignant cells or infectious etiologies.  He was\nevaluated by neuro-oncology and neurosurgery during his\nadmission.  He will follow up in brain tumor clinic for further\ndiagnostic work-up, including biopsy by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].\n\nFOLLOW UP PLAN:\n-Dilantin being tapered, off by Monday [**4-17**]\n-Continue Decadron now tapered to 6mg q8 on d/c.\n-Transitioning from dilantin to keppra (now at 1500BID)\n-Will follow up in brain tumor clinic next week (Monday)\n\n2. GI:  Pt did well from a GI perspective. Tolerated po intake.\nHe did have one episode of nausea/vomiting on [**4-11**] which was\nassociated with mildly elevated LFTs and [**Doctor First Name **]/lip.  KUB was OK.\nLabs normalized.  He had a CT scan of the Abd/Pelvis which\nshowed no evidence of disease recurrence.\nFOLLOW UP PLAN\n-continue PPI, pancreatic enzymes\n-follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 100239**] next week\n\n3. CV: TEE was done to evaluate for possiblity of endocarditis,\nshowed a tiny, mitral valve veg. Emperic abx (vanc and gent) was\nbegun, but later d/c'd (on [**2186-4-12**]) given very low suspicion for\nendocarditis\n\n4. ID:\n-Started Vanco and Gent for ? endocarditis -d/c'd [**4-12**], has\nremained afebrile since and blood cultures have been negative.\nAlso rec'd Levofloxacin x3 days (start [**4-2**]) for traumatic foley\ninsertion-now d/c'd.  Started dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].\n\nFOLLOW UP PLAN:\n-dapsone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] while on steroids and chemotherapy\n\n5. Pancreatic CA:  s/p #4 of 8 of gemcitabine-unsure if wants to\ncontinue chemo.  This decision pending prognosis of pancreatic\nand brain lesion. CT showed no disease recurrence.\n\nFOLLOW UP PLAN\n-Follow up with DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] next week\n-Will decide about next cycle of gemcitabine (#4 of 8) at next\nweek's appointment\n\n7. Heme: HCt fluctuating, fe studies normal, guiaic trace\npositive on Thursday. Will need repeat Hct next week at f/u with\nPCP.\n\nFOLLOW UP PLAN\n-Repeat CBC at F/U with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4844**]\n\n8.
