She was\nfound at outside hospital to have multiple brain lesions with\nmass effect on CT scan.\n\nHere an MRI of the head showed multiple, likely metastatic\nlesions of the brain. CT abd showed suspicious low attenuation\nlesion in dome of liver. CT head repeat showed multiple\nenhancing lesions including the largest in the right frontal\nlobe measuring 15 mm, most consistent with metastatic disease.\nUnchanged cerebral edema in the right frontal lobe with\nassociated mass effect upon right lateral ventricle, and no\ninterval development of hemorrhage or hydrocephalus. The patient\nunderwent bipsy on 2/209 which has confirmed CNS lymphoma.\n\nOvernight ([**2111-3-3**]) the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]\nafter triggering for hypoxia, for closer observation given O2\nsats in the 80's to low 90's while on a non re-breather venti\nmask.  On CXR on [**2111-3-3**] the patient was found to have new\ncollapse of the RML and RLL, in addition to enlarging pleural\neffusions compared to prior AP films.  On repeat imaging, the\nRML and RLL collapse had resolved and the patient's oxygenation\nstatus improved.  It is possible that the patient's hypoxia and\nRML/RLL collapse were due to her expanding pleural effusion or\nto a mucous plug. Given her improved clinical status, she was\ntransferred back to the OMED floor.\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Bipolar disorder\n- Anxiety\n- Hypothyroidism\n- Chronic ETOH use\n- Left distal radial fracture in [**2110-8-22**], chronic back pain,\nrecent fall with chin laceration and facial contusion, recent\nhospital admission for failure to thrive.\n\nSocial History:\nSmokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day.  There is a history of\nabout half pint vodka per day but has stopped.  She has home\nhealth aid for care for her 5 days/week.\n\n\nFamily History:\nNon-contributory.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVITAL SIGNS: T 95.4 F, BP 94/48, HR 59, RR 20, O2sat 99% on RA.\n\n\nGENERAL:  NAD. Oriented x3.\nSKIN:  Full turgor.\nHEENT:  NCAT. Sclera anicteric. Left sided facial droop\nimproved. Thrush. Conjunctiva pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the\noral mucosa.\nCARDIOVASCULAR: regular, normal S1, S2.\nPULMONARY: No chest wall deformities. Respirations were\nunlabored, decreased breath sounds at bases. Crackles on right\nbase.\nABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender, slightly-distended. g-tube site\nclean, dry, intact.\nEXTREMITIES:  No clubbing or cyanosis. Radial and DP pulses 2+\n\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  Her Karnofsky Performance Score is\n50.  She is awake, alert, and oriented to person and hospital\nonly.  She cannot name this place or the date, season, or year.\nThere is no right-left confusion but she cannot show me her\nthumb.  She has psychomotor slowing.  Her language apears fluent\nwith good comprehension.  Cranial Nerve Examination:  Her pupils\nare equal and reactive to light, 3 mm to 2 mm bilaterally.\nExtraocular\nmovements appears full; there is saccadic intrusion.  She blinks\nto threat in the right, but not the left, visual field.  She has\na left facial droop.  Corneal reflexes are intact bilaterally.\nHer hearing is grossly intact.  Her tongue is midline.  Palate\ngoes up in the midline.  Sternocleidomastoids and upper\ntrapezius appear strong.  Motor Examination:  She moves the left\nside less\nwell than the right.  Her muscle strengths are, in general, [**5-26**]\non the right and 4+/5 on the left.  Her muscle tone is normal.\nHer reflexes are 3+ bilaterally.  Her ankle jerks are absent.\nHer toes are down going.  Sensory examination is notable for\ngrimace to pinch applied to all 4 extremities.

There is a\ndiffuse dense infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells comprised\nof predominantly large cells, within finely dispersed chromatin\nand multiple small nucleoli.  There are focal areas of\nnecrosis/apoptosis, frequent mitosis as well as perivascular\ncuffing noted (see slide F).  Reticulin stain highlights\nmultiple vessel walls.\nBy immunohistochemistry performed on blocks E and F, the large\natypical cells are diffusely immuno reactive for leucocyte\ncommon antigen LCA (CD45) as well as pan B cell marker, CD20,\nand co-express bcl-6 and MUM-1.  They do not aberrantly express\nCD10 or TdT.  By MIB-1 staining, the proliferative fraction\namong the neoplastic cells is nearly 100%.  CD3 highlights few\nadmixed T cells.  EBV encoded RNA in situ hybridization stain\nfor [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name **] virus is negative.\nOverall, the findings are of a high grade B-cell non-Hodgkin\nlymphoma in keeping with a primary diffuse large B cell\nlymphatic of the CNS.\n\nCT head [**2111-2-18**]:\nMultiple enhancing cerebral lesions, with vasogenic edema\nsurrounding the largest of these in the right frontal lobe.\nFindings are concerning for metastatic disease.\n\nMRI head [**2111-2-20**]:\nMultiple enhancing masses suggesting most likely malignant\nneoplasm, metastatic or primary. Diffuse white matter\ninfiltration and cortical infiltration raises the possibility of\neither glial infiltration, or swelling related to recent seizure\nactivity.\n\nECHO [**2111-3-2**]:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are\nnormal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal\n(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally\nnormal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve\nstenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The anterior mitral\nvalve leaflet is mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic\npressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved\nglobal and regional biventricular systolic function. Mitral\nleaflet thickening with mild mitral regurgitation.\n\nVideo swallow [**2111-3-13**]:\nModerate oropharyngeal dysphagia, including aspiration of thin\nliquid. The patient is at significant risk for aspiration of\nother consistency if eating too quickly. Patient should repeat\nbedside swallow evaluation in one to two weeks. The swallowing\npattern correlates to a dysphagia outcome severity scale (DOSS)\nrating of 3, moderate dysphagia. Please refer to the speech\ntherapist's note for full evaluation and recommendation.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a 73 year old female with history of alcohol abuse,\ncirrhosis, bipolar disorder, and hypothyroidism, who was\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with mental status change, aphasia, left\nsided weakness and facial droop, and encephalopathy. She was\nfound at outside hospital to have multiple brain lesions with\nmass effect on CT scan.\n\nHere an MRI of the head showed multiple, likely metastatic\nlesions of the brain.  CT abd showed suspicious low attenuation\nlesion in dome of liver.  CT head repeat showed multiple\nenhancing lesions including the largest in the right frontal\nlobe measuring 15 mm, most consistent with metastatic disease.\nUnchanged cerebral edema in the right frontal lobe with\nassociated mass effect upon right lateral ventricle, and no\ninterval development of hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.  The\npatient underwent biopsy on [**2111-2-23**] which has confirmed CNS\nlymphoma.\n\nOvernight ([**2111-3-3**]) the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]\nafter triggering for hypoxia, for closer observation given O2\nsats in the 80's to low 90's while on a non re-breather venti\nmask.  On CXR on [**2111-3-3**] the patient was found to have new\ncollapse of the RML and RLL, in addition to enlarging pleural\neffusions compared to prior AP films.  She was diuresed and\nstarted on vanc/unasyn on [**2111-3-4**] for aspiration.  On [**2111-3-4**],\non repeat imaging, the RML and RLL collapse had resolved and the\npatient's oxygenation status improved.  It is possible that the\npatient's hypoxia and RML/RLL collapse were due to her expanding\npleural effusion or to a mucous plug.  Given her improved\nclinical status, she was transferred back to the OMED floor.\n\nThe patient received a G-tube and PORT placement on [**2111-3-12**].\nShe also received her second round of Methotrexate chemotherapy\nafter these procedures and Methotrexate levels followed until\nclear.  Her renal function remained normal throughout this\ntreatment.  At the time of discharge, she is alert and oriented\nx 3 with increasing function of her left upper and lower\nextremities to 4/5 strength.  She will be returning in two-weeks\nfor her next methotrexate treatment.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. Synthroid 88 mcg daily\n2. depakote 250mg daily\n3.
