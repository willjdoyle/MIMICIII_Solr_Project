Two right lung masses; one located posteriorly in the right\nupper lobe within the parenchyma, the other located in the right\nhilum. It is unclear if the mass located in the parenchyma\nrepresents primary tumor in the hilar mass, a nodal met. Other\nnodes are located in the right hilum and within the mediastinum.\nThe appearance of these lesions are worrisome for lung\ncarcinoma.\n2. Small pleural-based lesions within left lung also suspicious\nfor malignancy.\n3. Pockets of mediastinal air tracking into the soft tissues of\nthe neck consistent with patient's recent history of\nbronchoscopy.\n4.
