Concern for\nneoplasm.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted pre- and\npost-gadolinium enhanced\nMRI scanning of the brain was obtained.\n\nCOMPARISON STUDY ON PACS ARCHIVE: CT scan of the head performed\nearlier the\nsame day from an outside facility.\n\nFINDINGS: There is an avidly enhancing mass, though slightly\nless intensely\nenhancing within its center, sharply marginated and measuring\napproximately 12\nmm in diameter. It is likely intra-axial, although its most\nperipheral extent\nlies at the cortical surface of the left frontal lobe. There is\nextensive\nsurrounding edema. There are no other areas of pathological\ncontrast\nenhancement seen. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally\nmidline\nstructures. The mass shows slightly restricted diffusion. Within\nthe right\nparietal lobe white matter is a 3-mm area of fluid signal\nintensity which does\nnot exhibit pathological enhancement. Its etiology is uncertain,\nalthough it\nmay represent a dilated perivascular space, as opposed to a\nchronic lacunar\ninfarct. More typically linear perivascular spaces are seen\nwithin the white\nmatter of both cerebral hemispheres, largely in a periatrial\ndistribution.\n\nThe mass appears to have very slight susceptibility.\n\nThe principal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is\nmoderate\nmucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus, and to a\nminor degree in\nthe right mastoid sinus, consistent with an ongoing inflammatory\nprocess.\n\nCONCLUSION: Solitary left frontal mass with possible small\nhemorrhagic\ncomponent. Given these characteristics, either a hemorrhagic\nprimary or\nmetastatic neoplasm, or potentially a metastatic, melanin-based\ntumor needs to\nbe considered.\n\n\n[**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname **] [**Medical Record Number 89528**] M  58  [**2064-5-28**]\n\nRadiology Report CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of\n[**2123-1-30**] 3:37 PM\n\n\n[**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] FA11 [**2123-1-30**] 3:37 PM\nCT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST   Clip #\n[**Clip Number (Radiology) 89530**]\nReason: evaluate for malignancy\nContrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 130\n\n\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n   58 year old man with brain mass\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\n   evaluate for malignancy\nCONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:\n   None.\n\n\n\nFinal Report\nINDICATION: 58-year-old man with brain mass, to evaluate for\nmalignancy.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were acquired from the thoracic\ninlet to the\nsymphysis pubis following oral and intravenous contrast. Coronal\nand sagittal\nreformats were produced and reviewed. In addition, non-contrast\nand\nthree-minute delayed post-IV contrast images were obtained\nthrough the liver.\n\nCT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:\nThere is an enlarged lymph node seen in the left axilla\nmeasuring 1.6 x 2.3 x\n3.3 cm. There are several smaller lymph nodes seen adjacent to\nthis, the\nlargest measures 1 cm in short axis, but has a very rounded\nappearance\nconcerning for malignant involvement. In the left shoulder\nregion, lateral to\nthe subscapularis muscle (3:17), there is a large enhancing soft\ntissue\nnodule. This appears to be separate from the subscapularis\nmuscle measuring\n4.4 x 3 x 3.2 cm. No right axillary lymphadenopathy seen. There\nis also a\nlarge left subpectoral enhancing mass seen measuring 6.4 x 5.1 x\n3.3cm. There\nis a small right hilar lymph node measuring 6 mm in short axis.\nNo other\nmediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are seen. Bibasilar dependent\natelectasis\nnoted. There is a small area of linear scarring in the left\nupper lobe. No\nconcerning pulmonary nodules are seen. No pleural effusions. No\npericardial\neffusions. The heart and great vessels are unremarkable in\nappearance.\n\nCT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:\nNo focal liver lesions are seen. The portal vein and hepatic\nveins are\npatent. No biliary duct dilatation seen. The gallbladder is\nunremarkable in\nappearance. The spleen, both adrenal glands and both kidneys are\nunremarkable\nin appearance. The pancreas is unremarkable in appearance. At\nthe splenic\nhilum and in the left subdiaphragmatic space, there are several\nsmall round\nsoft tissue nodules seen. These most likely represent splenules\nhowever these\ncould represent small lymph nodes. There is a 1.6-cm portacaval\nnode seen\n(2:61). There are multiple tiny paraaortic lymph nodes seen,\nnone of which\nmeet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement. Similarly,\nthere are small\nmesenteric lymph nodes which do not meet CT size criteria for\npathologic\nenlargement. No mesenteric stranding seen. The small and large\nbowel are\nnormal in caliber. No free fluid seen.\n\nCT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:\nThe urinary bladder, rectum and prostate are unremarkable in\nappearance. No\nfree fluid seen. No pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.\n\nBONY STRUCTURES:\nMild degenerative changes noted in the lumber spine with a\ngentle scoliosis\nconvex to the right. Sclerosis in the anterior vertebral body of\nL2 may be\nrelated to degenerative change, metastasis cannot be excluded on\nthis study.\nBilateral pars defects noted. Degenerative changes seen in the\nleft hip.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla. Left shoulder soft\ntissue mass\nmeasuring 4.5 cm. Left subpectoral soft tissue mass measuring\n6.4 cm. The\nappearance raises suspicion most for a melanoma primary in the\nleft upper\nextremity or shoulder area, though other tumors in this region\nare possible.\nDirect sampling by ultrasound guidance could be performed if\nneeded.\n\n2. 1.6-cm portacaval node. Small paraaortic lymph nodes also\nnoted.\n\n3.

Within the surgical bed within the\nleft frontal\nlobe, there are blood products and surrounding edema within the\nwhite matter\nwith minimal surrounding mass effect. Due to the hemorrhage\nwithin the\nsurgical site, which is intrinsically T1 hyperintense,\nevaluation of residual\nenhancing mass in this region is limited.\n\nThe ventricles are not significantly changed in size compared\nwith the\npre-operative study. The major intracranial flow voids are\npresent. The\nbasal cisterns are patent.\n\nThere is mucus/fluid within the right mastoid air cells. The\nparanasal\nsinuses are clear.

He reports that he had a normal\ncolonoscopy a few years ago and recently underwent a skin biopsy\nof neck lesion that was reportedly normal or basal cell.  He was\nin his usual state of health when his R arm suddenly extended\nfollowed by LOC and he was witnessed to have generalized\nconvulsion lasting a few minutes.  He was initially taken to an\nOSH where head CT showed L frontal lesion with significant\nsurrounding edema hence he was transferred here for further care\nafter being loaded with Dilantin.\n\nHe was initially admitted to neurology service where MRI of head\nwith and without contrast showed an enhancing 1.2cm solitary\nlesion in the L frontal lobe most concerning for melanoma.  CT\ntorso also showed large L axillary lymph node which was biopsied\nper interventional radiology on [**2-1**].  Path report pending at\nthe time of discharge.\n\nAlthough concerning for metastatic melanoma, given the isolated\nlesion and surround edema, neuro-oncology consult (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**]) recommended resection.  He was taken to OR per\nneurosurgery/Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2-2**] for resection and patient\nwas transferred to neurosurgery after the resection.\n\nOf note, given the concern for malignancy, Dilantin was switched\nto Keppra 1g [**Hospital1 **] and he did not have any further events\nconcerning for seizure.  He also underwent EEG during this\nadmission which was normal as well.\n\nOn [**2-3**], patient was taken to the OR for L frontal craniotomy\nfor resection of mass. OR was uncomplicated and patient was\ntaken to the ICU. On post op check, a slight R drift and\nexpressive aphasia was noted, he was full strength otherwise. On\n[**2-4**], facial twitching was observed by nursing and was relieved\nwith ativan. He was placed on EEG monitoring, Keppra was\nincreased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]. Patient continued to have seizures and\nativan was given. Neurology was consulted and dilantin was\nadded. On [**2-5**], on examination patient had RUE weakness 4/5, but\nwas full strenght otherwise, he was alert and oriented to self\nand place and expressive aphasia persists. EEG was Dc'ed on\n[**2-6**]. He remained neurologically stable.\n\nHe was seen by PT and OT and deemed safe for d/c to home with\nservices.  He agreed with this plan.
