Breast Cancer(patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**]: metastatic to\nbone(multiple vertebral bodies, lytic lesions seen throughout\nthe pelvis and lower lumbar spine ) Has lesions in brain which\nare not consistant with metastasis, consistant with glioma.\nCurrrently on Xeloda and Zometa.

The\nenhancing lesion in the right side of the sphenoid bone, either\nbenign soft tissue or metastatic sisease is stable. There are\ntwo enhancing lesions in the frontal bones which may be slightly\nmore sistinct than formerly. They probably reflect bone\nmetastases.\n.\n[**1-8**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.\n.\n[**2148-1-9**] CXR: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.\n.\n[**2148-1-11**] Brain MRI: No evidence of metastatic disease.
