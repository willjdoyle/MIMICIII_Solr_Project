New mild\nhydrocephalus of unclear etiology.\n\nCT head [**2188-7-10**]:\n1.  Stable appearance of the three known metastases in\ncomparison to the prior exam performed 10 hours prior.  There is\nno evidence of new hemorrhage, mass effect, or infarction.\n2.  Stable mass effect on the left lateral ventricle with\npersistent  ventriculomegaly, unchanged from the prior exam\nperformed 10 hours earlier, but increased from the prior MRI in\n[**2188-5-13**].\n\nMRI Head [**2188-7-11**]:\n1. Increase in size of left occipital lobe lesion with increased\nmass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle,\nsimilar degree of subependymal spread along the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]\nof the left lateral ventricle and mild adjacent mass effect and\nrightward deviation of the posterior falx.\n2. Second lesion just adjacent to the vermis within the left\nocciput and right frontal lesion have decreased in size compared\nto the prior examination.\n3. Mildly increased size of the ventricles compared to the prior\nexam.\n\nMRI Head [**2188-7-12**]:\n1. Status post left occipital craniotomy, expected post-surgical\nchanges are seen, consistent with edema in the surgical bed and\nresidual blood products. There is persistent residual mass\neffect in the left ventricular trigone and associated vasogenic\nedema.\n2. The area with enhancement in the left occipital lobe has been\nremoved, the possibility of residual mass cannot be completely\nexcluded, followup is advised.  Unchanged right frontal\nenhancing lesion.

Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.\n\n2. S/p left occipital mass resection. Related findings are\nbetter assessed on the [**2188-7-12**] MRI.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n53 yo RH woman with stage IV NSCLC with brain mets s/p steroid\ntherapy and whole-brain radiation completed on [**2188-6-18**] presenting\nwith sudden-onset N/V and lethargy, found to have increased size\nof left occipital mass with significant vasogenic edema\n.\n# OCCIPITAL MASS: Patient was admitted to medicine on after CT\nhead showed large left occipital mass. In the ED she was started\non dexamethasone and keppra. On HD#2 she became more lethargic\nso neurosurgery consult was obtained. She was transferred to ICU\nand started seizure prophylaxis. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] met with the family\nto discuss the option of surgery, and family met with palliative\ncare to discuss comfort options.On HD#3 her neurological status\nsignificantly improved, and the decision was made to pursue\noperative care. That evening, she underwent right EVD drain\nplacement, followed by a left craniotomy with metastasis\nexcision. The operation was without complications. Following the\nprocedure, the patient was extubated and transported back to the\nICU.  Her steroid dose was escalated with accompanying\npercautions. On HD#4 (POD #1), she was AAOx3 with fluid speech\nand intact repetition/comprehension, but reported NEW right\nhemianopia likely secondary to mass resection. She was\ntransferred to stepdown unit. On HD#4 (POD #2), her neuro exam\nremained stable. Dressings were removed, wound C/D/I. Her EVD\nremained open at 10 mmHg. On HD#5, patient returned to OR for VP\nshunt placement. Her EVD was clamped prior to procedure. Right\nVP shunt was placed and EVD removed during procedure. Follow-up\nCT showed good shunt placement and small intraventricular\nhemorrhage. On HD#6 she was tolerating PO diet and meds.  She\nwas seen and evaluated by physical therapy who recommended acute\nrehab. Steroids to taper to Dexamethsaone 2mg [**Hospital1 **] and continute\nuntil follow up in brain tumor clinic.\n.\n# GOALS OF CARE: Patient's family initially requested palliative\ncare consult, and plan was for CMO until her neurologic status\nimproved on HD#3 and patient requested surgery. On HD#6 she and\nfamily expressed interest in discharge to hospice. Hospice\nconsult was obtained and will follow her through her rehab\nperiod\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.\nInformation was obtained from PharmacywebOMR.\n1.
