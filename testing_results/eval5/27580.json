Arrived at ER at\n8:30pm drowsy with eyes closed, moving left limbs spontaneously\nand no observed movement of right limbs to noxious stimuli.  She\nwas unresponsive to commands.\n.\nCT negative for acute bleed, ? hyperdense left MCA. Also showing\na calcified mass in the ventricle that was determined to be of\nlow bleeding risk by head of neuroradiology.\n.\nPt without contraindications to tPA. Son consented and patient\nreceived 6.8mg bolus, then drip of 61.2mg was started of\nalteplase. Roughly 30min after infusion was started, pt was\nnoted to become bradycardic to 40s and repeat EKG showed IW MI.\nPt was intubated, as she was felt to have lost her gag reflex\nand tPA was stopped.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nHTN\nHyperlipidemia\n\nSocial History:\nLives independantly, family in the area\n\nFamily History:\nnon-contributory\n\nPhysical Exam:\nGen Elderly woman drowsy in NAD\nCV RRR\nPulm CTAb\nAbd Benign\nExt no edema\n.\nNeuro\nMental status: Responds to voice by opening eyes and occasional\nturn of head to the left. Spontaneously moving left limbs. No\nspontaneous speech; unable to follow commands.\n\nMotor: No movement to noxious stimuli on right side, spontaneous\nmovement of leg on left.\n\nSensory: no facial griamcing or other response to noxious\nstimuli applied to the right side.  She withdraws left side to\nstimulation.\n\nGait: unable to assess\n\nCoordination: unable to assess on the right side.\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nAdmission Head CT:\nFINDINGS:  No intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of\nnormally\nmidline structures, or major vascular territorial infarct is\napparent.  There is slightly increased density in the left MCA.\nIf there is a clinical concern for a left MCA territory infarct\nan MRI would be recommended.  There is a 1.2 x 1.7 cm calcified\nlesion in the superior aspect of the right lateral ventricle.\nThe etiology of this could also be further evaluated with MRI.\nCalcifications are seen within the basal ganglia bilaterally.\nThere also is a small punctate calcification in the right\ntemporal lobe and brainstem, which are likely vascular in\nnature.  The bony structures are unremarkable.  The visualized\nportions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well\naerated.  The surrounding soft tissue structures are\nunremarkable.\n.\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  No CT evidence of acute ischemia.\n2.  Increased density in the left MCA.  If there is a clinical\nconcern for\nleft MCA territory infarct, an MRI would be recommended.\n3.  Calcified lesion in the right lateral ventricle, which may\nrepresent a\ncalcified A-V malformation, among other possibilities.  MRI\ncould help in\nfurther workup.\n.\nNOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed this study\nwith Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] at approximately 9 pm on [**2102-7-30**]. At that time, [**Doctor Last Name **]\noffered the\nfollowing discussion: There are several intraventricular\ncalcifications, in addition to the mass near the foramen of\n[**Last Name (un) 2044**]. The differential diagnosis included an intraventricular\nneoplasm, such as a meninigioma, choroid plexus papilloma,\noligodendroglioma, neurocytoma or giant cell astrocytoma. Some\nof these lesions arise from the choroid plexus, which is absent\nin the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. Thus, if this is a choroid-origin lesion,\nit may be pedunculated. There is also an abnormal calcification\nextending inferiorly into the suprasellar cistern. Although a\ncraniopharyngioma may calcify and arise in the suprasellar\ncistern, invagination into the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] would be unusual.\nThe lesion does not appear to represent a neoplasm with a high\nbleeding risk, such as a metastasis or malignant glioma. It does\nnot appear to be an arteriovenous malformation. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15758**]\nCT are much more sensitive than noncontrast CT for detecting\nearly ischemia or infarction, but there is no evidence of\nhemorrhage. The slight increased density in the left MCA may\nrepresent calcification or thrombus.\n.\nRepeat Head CT, [**7-30**], after tPA administration:\nFINDINGS:  Compared to prior study two hours earlier, there is\nnow new right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is no\nsignificant associated mass effect or shift of normally midline\nstructures.  The ventricular system is stable in appearance.\nOtherwise, there has been no significant short interval change.\n.\nIMPRESSION:  New right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n.\nNOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There appears to be [**Last Name (un) 940**] of\n[**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white\ndifferentiation in the left MCA territory, suggesting early\ninfarction.\n.\nHead CT [**7-31**]:\nFINDINGS:  Comparison is made to [**2102-7-30**].\n.\nThere are multiple large intraparenchymal hematomas in the right\ncerebral\nhemisphere, the largest measuring approximately 6.7 x 5.4 cm.\nThese hematomas are causing extensive  right sided subfalcine,\nuncal, transtentorial, and bilateral cerebellar tonsillar\nherniations.\n.\nHypodensity surrounding the hematomas were seen, consistent with\nvasogenic\nedema.\n.\nThere is loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter junction essentially\ndiffusely\nthroughout the brain, consistent with brain edema. There is a\nsuggestion of possible left middle cerebral artery territory\nedema, which could indicate the clinically suspected evolving\ninfarct originally requiring treatment, but imaging of this\nregion is markedly limited by the marked generalized brain\nedema, noted previously. A 1cm linear area of hyperdensity is\nseen within the brain stem, which likely represents a Duret\nhemorrhage. Some subarachnoid hemorrhage along the right\ncerebral convexity surface is again noted.\n.\nNo focal bony abnormalities are seen. The visualized orbits and\nparanasal\nsinuses are normal.\n.\nIMPRESSION:  Since [**2102-7-30**], new massive right cerebral\nintraparenchymal\nhematomas causing subfalcine, uncal, transtentorial, and\ntonsillar herniation. Duret hemorrhage.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient arrived to the ER within 3 hours of symptom onset.\nThe clinical presentation highly suggested that she had an acute\nischemic stroke of the left MCA territory and CT was showing\nevidence for left MCA occlusion.  Given the additional findings\non CT, a discussion was held with the head of neuroradiology\nprior to initiation of t-PA treatment.  Given a potentially\nelevated risk from t-PA, the benefits versus risk of t-PA were\ndiscussed with the patient's son who gave consent to proceed\nwith IV t-PA administered within three hours of symptom onset.\nAfter tPA administration, the patient developed bradycardia and\nrespiratory distress, t-PA was discontinued and she was\nintubated prior to admission to the SICU for further monitoring.\n A repeat head CT showed subarachnoid hemorraghe in the right\nhemisphere without midline shift or parenchymal bleeding and\nthere was further evidence for left MCA territory ischemic\nstroke.  The following morning, she had developed new neuro\nfindings concerning for brainstem damage (pinpoint, unreactive\npupils, mute reflexes, negative oculocephalic reflexes, cold\ncalorics, gag, and corneal reflexes) and the patient. was taken\nfor urgent head CT.  This showed evidence of known left MCA\ninfarction.  In the interim, the patient had also developed\nmassive R hemispheric hemorrhage with subfalcine, uncal,\ntranstentorial, and tonsillar herniation.  The situation was\ndiscussed with the family including the patient's son from\n[**State 3706**] who decided that they would like the patient to be\nDNR/DNI.  She developed bradycardia, cardiac arrest and expired,\nwith family at the bedside.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nantihypertensive, antihyperlipidemia\n\nDischarge Medications:\nNone\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nL MCA infarction\nR hemispheric intracerebral hemorrhage with subfalcine, uncal,\ntranstentorial, and tonsillar herniation\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nNone\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nNone\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2102-8-2**]",
