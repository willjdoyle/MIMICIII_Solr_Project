There is no\nevidence of aneurysm, AVM, or other vascular cause; Probable 7mm\npseudoaneurysm arising from the distal right superficial\ntemporal artery with adjacent subcutaneous soft tissue injury;\nChronic right occipital infarct.\n\nMR head ([**2179-1-2**]):  Right basal ganglia signal abnormality with\nblood products and irregular enhancement could be due to a\nsubacute infarct with enhancement or less likely due to an\nenhancing primary neoplasm. Given the appearances are more\nsuggestive of a subacute infarct, a followup study should be\nobtained; Moderate ventriculomegaly out of proportion for sulci\nindicates normal pressure hydrocephalus in proper clinical\nsetting; Right frontal scalp hematoma with a small 1-cm area of\ngadolinium enhancement could be due to active extravasation at\nthe time of imaging.\n\nEEG: normal EEG in the waking and sleeping states.  Note is made\nof a poorly organized background rhythm which is a normal\nvariant. There were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic\nseizures.\n\nMR head (with ASL and MR Spec): process in the right basal\nganglia most likely represents a slightly atypical appearance of\nevolving non- and hemorrhagic contusion related to the patient's\ntrauma (with overlying subgaleal hematoma); Subacute infarct\nwith subsequent hemorrhagic conversion (serendipitously\nsubjacent to the site of scalp trauma) seems less likely; No\nincreased perfusion or spectroscopic abnormality to specifically\nsuggest underlying neoplasm.\n\nBronchial Lavage: Negative for malignant cells\n\nFNA (lung nodule): atypical\n\nTTE: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are\nnormal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic\narch. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined.\nThe aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is\nmild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)\nmitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic\npressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial\neffusion.\n\nTEE: Small mobile echodensity on the aortic valve as described\nabove c/w Lambl's or vegetation. Mild aortic regurgitation.\nInteratrial septal aneurysm with possible patent foramen ovale\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 90431**] is a 64 year old with recurrent AFib (converted)\non coumadin and\ndiabetes found 300 feet from his car (driving alone), on\ntheground confused, with right frontal subgaleal hematoma\n\nBasal Ganglia Lesion: Initial MR imaging showed right basal\nganglia signal abnormality with blood products. It was unclear\nif this was due to atypical hematoma, underlying mass that bled,\nunderlying AVM that bled or stroke with hemorrhagic conversion.\nA CTA was obtained to see if any vascular abnormalities could be\nidentified; no evidence of aneurysm, AVM, or other vascular\ncause was identified. Given the possibility of an underlying\nmass, CT torso was evaluated and a derm consult was obtained to\nlook for any possible primary tumors. No evidence of skin lesion\nconcerning for melanoma as per Derm, but there was pulmonary\nnodules (largest of which is 1.2 cm) identified. At the request\nof Neuro-oncology, MRI was repeated with ASL and Spectroscopy.\nBased on these sequences, there was low suspicion of underlying\nneoplasm and the final report noted that the process in the\nright basal ganglia most likely represents a slightly atypical\nappearance of evolving non- and hemorrhagic contusion. While\nthis is possible, it would not explain why he became\nunresponsive, resulting in the trauma. Images reviewed with\nstroke attending and there was concern that there might have\nbeen an underlying AVM or cavernoma that resulted in the bleed,\nwhich was subacute, and which resulted in a seizure. A subacute\nbleed would also explain the findings noted by his girlfried\nthat he had been having increased confusion and falls in the 2\n[**Last Name (un) 90433**] prior to admission. A routine EEG was obtained; this was\nnormal. However, given the concern for seizure activity\nresulting in his unresponsive episode, he was started on Keppra;\nhis current dose is 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]. The plan is for him to have a\nrepeat MRI 6 weeks from the initial MRI and than follow-up with\nDr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. If there is any evidence of unerlying mass on the\nrepeat MRI, he will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in the\n[**Hospital **] clinic.\n\nLambl's Excursions: Given his history of stroke and the\npossibility that his right basal ganglia lesion was due to\nhemorrhagic conversion of a stroke, an ECHO was performed to\nevaluate for clot. The TTE showed an elongated left atrium but\nwas otherwise normal. A TEE was then performed, which showed\nsmall mobile echodensity on the aortic valve as described above\nc/w Lambl's or vegetation. No evidence of any infection and\nblood cultures have been taken and have remained sterile, so\nunlikely vegetation. A Lambl's excursion can produce clots,\nresulting in strokes. Of note, he was also on Coumadin in the\npast for a.fib, but this was held on admission due to his bleed.\nCurrently, it is beleived that the risk of restarting Coumadin\ngiven the basal ganglia hemorrhagic contusion/hemorrhage\noutweighs the benefit of starting it for stroke prevention.\nHowever, given his history of a. fib, right basal gnaglia\nstroke, and now the finding of the echodensity on aortic valve,\nhe will likely need to be restarted on Coumadin in future,\nparticularly after repeat MRI if blood products resolved and no\nevidence of underlying mass. At this time, he was started on ASA\n325 mg for stroke prevention and will be continued on this until\nit is safe to restart him on Coumadin.\n\nPulm Nodule: On CT torso, pulmonary nodules were found, largest\none being 1.2 cm. He had a bronchial lavage and FNA of the\nnodule. The bronchial lavage was negative for malignant cells.\nThe FNA was atypical but nondiagnostic. He will follow-up with\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and have a PET scan for evaluation of this nodule in 4\nweeks.\n\nDiabetes: He has history of diabetes and was on Humalog and\nLantus at home. During hospitalization, he remained on sliding\nscale insulin. His FSGs on day of discharge were in upper 100s\nand low 200s. He was NPO multiple days for studies/procedures so\nLantus and Humalog were not restarted, but when he returns to\nhis usual regimen in rehab/as outpatient, restarting his home\ndiabetic regimen should be considered.\n\nUTI: He was found to have UTI and was started on a 10 day course\nof Bactrim. He will complete this course at rehab.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nHumalog 20 Units\nLantus 40 Units\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n2. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n3. sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 800-160 mg Tablet Sig: One (1)\nTablet PO BID (2 times a day) for 3 days.\n4. Insulin\nPlease follow sliding scale insulin as provided.\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1108**] Rehab Unit at\n[**Hospital6 1109**] - [**Location (un) 1110**]\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nR basal ganglia bleed -ruptured AVM vs. hematoma vs. hemorrhagic\nconversion of stroke vs. underlying mass\nLikely seizure\npulmonary nodule\nLambl's Excrecence\nDM\nold R occipital stroke\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused - sometimes.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker\nor cane).\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n  You came to the hospital after being found unresponsive by\nyour car. You were initially admitted to the trauma ICU, but\nthere was no evidence of any traumatic injuries found on\nimaging, so you were transferred to the neurology service. MRI\nof your head showed blood in the part of your brain called the\nbasal ganglia; it is unclear if this blood is from a traumatic\ninjury, from an underlying stroke or mass or from a rupted\narterial malformation. You underwent further brain imaging to\nhelp clarify, and while definitive results are limited by the\nblood that is present, it does not appear that there is an\nunderlying mass.\n  During the work-up for the brain imaging abnormality, you had\na CT scan of your torso, which showed some pulmonary nodules.\nYou underwent a procedure called bronchial lavage and fine\nneedle aspiration of the nodule to see if the nodule was\nmalignant. The FNA results were inconclusive, so the pulmonary\nservice would like to see in 4 weeks with a PET scan to\nfollow-up on this.\n  Given the bleeding found in your head, it is likely that you\nhad a seizure and this resulted in your unresponsive episode;\nyou were started on an antiseizure medication called Keppra.\n  Given your history of stroke and the possibility that this was\na stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, you had imaging of your\nheart to see if there were any clots. The TTE showed enlargement\nof the left atrium, so a more invasive procedure called\ntransesophageal echo was performed. This showed likely Lambel's\nExcrecence on your aortic valve; this has a low likelihood of\nsending clots, resulting in strokes. Given your bleed, we\nbelieve the risks of anticoagulation with Coumadin outweigh the\nbenefits at this time, so we have started you on Aspirin 325 mg.\nAfter your repeat MRI, we may consider starting Coumadin again\nfor stroke prevention.\n  With your likely seizure, as per Massachussets law, you are\nnot allowed to drive for 6 months.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nProvider: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] (pulmonary), MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3020**]\nDate/Time:[**2179-2-23**] 8:30\n\nProvider: [**Name10 (NameIs) 1532**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8786**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3020**]\nDate/Time:[**2179-2-23**] 9:30\n\nProvider: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 162**] (neurology), MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**]\nDate/Time:[**2179-3-1**] 2:30\n\nYou will be contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding PET scan, which pulmonary is\nrequesting prior to follow-up with them.\n\nAn MRI has been ordered for you for [**2179-2-15**] (please do not get\nearlier than this date as it needs to be 6 weeks from initial\nMRI to make sure blood products have cleared).
