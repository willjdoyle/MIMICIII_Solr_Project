When his son came into his room he noticed he\nwas shaking his arms and legs B/L for about 2 min. His son kept\ncalling his name, eventually the shaking stopped, but when the\npt\ntried to open his eyes, his son noted that his eyes were rolling\ninto the back of his head. There was no B/B loss. His son felt\nthat his speech was completely incoherent, and called 911. He\nstates that the pt also felt hot to the touch. His son states\nthat the pt had been complaining yesterday of not feeling well,\nand had had a HA, but his son took his temperature and he was\nafebrile at 98F. His son also states that over the past few\ndays,\nhe has been dragging his RLE more than usual. He states there\nhave been no other seizures since his last discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]\n[**12-15**]. He was brought to [**Hospital3 15402**] Hosp, where he was found to\nhave a fever to 102.4 F, and repeat NCHCT showed significant L\nsided vasogenic edema and 6 mm shift. He was given Tylenol, 1 mg\nAtivan and 8 mg Decadron, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Here, he is\nafebrile, but was given Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.

Mass effect with 7mm\nrightward midline shift.\n.\nNon-Contast CT Head ([**2135-2-8**]):\nIMPRESSION: Status post left basal ganglia mass biopsy, without\nsignificant hemorrhage.\n.\nTTE ([**2135-2-7**]):\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The\nestimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size\nand regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral\nand tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function,\nand a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThe aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic\nvalve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There\nis no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is\nseen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is\nnormal. There is no pericardial effusion.\n.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-12-10**],\ntrace aortic regurgitation is now seen in the presence of normal\nvalve morphology.\nIf the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high,\na TEE is suggested to better define the aortic valve.\n.\nRenal Ultrasound ([**2135-2-7**]):\nIMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral renal cysts, some of which\ncontains low-level internal echoes and septations.\n.\nPATHOLOGY\nNote:\nFinal note: The findings in aggregate are sufficient for a\ndiagnosis of Glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).\n\n.\nCT head [**2135-2-9**]\nFINDINGS: Again seen is left frontal burr hole with mild soft\ntissue swelling\nand associated gas in the soft tissues, biopsy tract, and within\nthe biopsied\nleft basal ganglia lesion. This lesion measures approximately 39\nx 33 mm and\nagain demonstrates hyperattenuating rim and hypodense center,\nwith associated\nvasogenic edema. There is no large area of acute hemorrhage.\nThere is\nunchanged mass effect with effacement of adjacent sulci and the\nleft lateral\nventricle, as well as unchanged rightward displacement of the\nnormally midline\nstructures by 7 mm. There is no evidence of transtentorial or\nuncal\nherniation. There is no large vascular territorial infarct. Two\nsatellite\nlesions with similar characteristics in the superior left\nfrontal lobe are\nagain visualized, measuring 18 x 12 and 13 x 9 mm.\n\nAgain demonstrated is an arachnoid cyst in the left posterior\nfossa. The\nparanasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. There are no\nfractures.\n\nIMPRESSION: No new hemorrhage. Biopsied left basal ganglia mass\nand\nsatellite lesions.\n\nCXR [**2135-2-11**]\n\nFINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of\nthe cardiac\nsilhouette has minimally increased. There is evidence of minimal\nenlargement\nof the perihilar vessels, potentially suggestive of mild\npulmonary edema.\n\nThe pre-existing subtle retrocardiac parenchymal opacities have\nmarkedly\ndecreased. Currently, no safe evidence of focal parenchymal\nopacities\nsuggesting an infectious disease are present.\n\nNo evidence of pleural effusions.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 487**] is a 57 year-old right-handed man with past medical\nhistory including hypertension, hepatitis C, cryoglobulinemia,\nCKD, and prior left basal ganglia hemorrhage thought to be\nconcerning for underlying malignancy who presented to [**Hospital3 **]\nfollowing seizure activity and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]\nafter a non-contrast CT of the head revealed significant\nvasogenic edema surrounding the left basal ganglia mass lesion\nassociated with midline shift.  He was admitted to the stroke\nservice from on [**2135-2-6**].\n.\nNEURO\nFollowing his arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], a non-contrast CT of the\nhead was repeated to evaluate for evolution of the lesion.  The\nimaging was thought to show interval enlargement in left basal\nganglia lesion with worsening surrounding\nvasogenic edema concerning for underlying neoplasm.  The\nNeurosurgery Team was invited to participate in the patient's\ncare, and performed a stereotactic biopsy of the lesion on\n[**2135-2-8**].  Preliminary results of the frozen section indicate\nmalignanct glioma and final pathologic review demonstrated a WHO\nstage 4 malignant glioma.\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] of neuro-oncology was consulted and recommended\nstarting dexamethasone 4 mg q6h.  He underwent MRI brain [**2-10**] for\nstaging purposes, but unfortunately did not tolerate this study\ndue to agitation.  Radiation oncology are also actively\nparticipating in Mr. [**Known lastname 13396**] care and radiation therapy was\ninitiated on [**2-11**].  Treatments are to continue every other day\nthereafter per radiation oncology's protocol.\n.\nHe has had problems with disorientation and inattention,\nworsening on [**2-10**] and [**2-11**].  His keppra was increased to 1000 mg\n[**Hospital1 **] and was started on ativan 0.5 mg tid on [**2-10**] as he had been\non a benzodiazepine at home prior to admission.  A routine EEG\ncompleted on [**2-11**] demonstrated diffuse encephalopathy without\nevidence of seizure activity or foci.\n.\nID\nThere was concern for underlying infection and/or the presence\nof a brain abscess given the ring-enhancing apperance of the\nleft basal ganglia lesion and the patient's recent history of\nstrep pneumonia bacteremia ([**12-15**]).  Accordingly, empiric\ncoverage with broad spectrum acntibiotics (vancomycin,\nceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, flagyl) was started pending\nfurther investigatory results.  In the setting of chronic kidney\ndisease and low suspician for HSV infection, the acyclovir was\nsoon discontinued.  No vegetations, thrombi, masses, or septal\ndefects were noted on a trans-thoracic echocardiogram.  Upon\nlearning news of the biopsy result, the antibiotics were\ndiscontinued, as was the infectious work up.  On [**2-11**], the\npatient's WBC increased from 8.6 to 16.6.  He had diarrhea as\nwell as mild abdominal pain.  A c. dif was negative x1, LFTs\nwere normal with the exception of an AST of 78 and lipase of 81,\nand a plain film of his abdomen revealed no obvious pathology.\nA bladder scan revealed > 1000 cc of urine.  He had a low-grade\ntemperature (100.3 axillary) [**2-11**] and was pancultured.  A\nurinalysis and CXR showed no obvious infectious proces.\nAllblood cultures where negative.\n\nONCOLOGY\nGiven the high suspicion for malignancy, a renal ultrasound was\nperformed.  The study revealed multiple bilateral renal cysts,\nsome of which contained low-level internal echoes and\nseptations.\n.\nRENAL\nThe patient has chronic renal disease and has been on\nhemodialysis in the past, but not recently.  His creatinine this\nhospitalization ranged from [**2-9**] which is consistent with his\nbaseline and has been receiving gentle hydration.  All future\nmedications should be renally dosed.  Keppra is currently above\nthe recommended renal dosing given the patient's risk of\nseizure, but he has tolerated this dose well.\n.\nCARDIOVASCULAR\nThe patient has been somewhat hypertensive with blood pressures\n160s-170s/100-110s.  His home diovan was resumed and treatment\nwith metoprolol was initiated.  Medications may be uptitrated as\nneeded.\n.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLevetiracetam 1,000 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nSertraline 100 mg qhs\nTriazolam 0.25 mg qhs\nDiovan 80 mg qd\nFurosemide 40 mg qd\nOxycodone-Acetaminophen 5 mg-325 mg q6h prn pain.\nRenal Caps 1 mg qd\n.\nALL: ASA\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
