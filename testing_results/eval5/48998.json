The size of this coalescent lesion has\nbeen fluctuating since [**2162-12-31**], but appears stable since [**Month (only) 958**]\n[**2165**]. The extent of vasogenic edema cannot be assessed precisely\nin this limited T1-weighted study, but appears grossly stable\nsince the [**2166-5-23**] study.\n\nThere is right frontovertex burr hole with abandoned\nventriculostomy tract and associated gliosis, better-appreciated\non the prior exam from [**2166-5-23**].

Post-surgical changes in the left cerebellar hemisphere, with\nblood\nproducts and small foci of gas and post-surgical changes with\nenhancement in the adjacent dura; possible mild narrowing of the\nleft transverse sinus, needs attention on followup.\n2. Areas of nodular enhancement noted medial to the area of\nblood products, which may relate to inflammation/tumor.\nContinued close followup to assess for residual tumor.\n3. Assessment for any associated infarction-related decreased\ndiffusion is\nlimited on the present study. Other details as above.\n4. Mildly increased signal intensity in the right mastoid air\ncells from\nmucosal thickening/small amount of fluid.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Known lastname 102871**] was admitted for elective left suboccipital\ncraniotomy for resection of left cerebellar metastasis.\nPostoperatively she was extubated and transfered to the ICU for\nQ1 hour neurochecks and systolic blood pressure control less\nthan 140.  She received Vancomycin and gentamycin for\nperiorperative prophylaxis.  Postoperatively she was started on\nDexamethasone 4mg Q6 with GI prophylaxis. Postoperative Head CT\nshowed expected post-op findings with no acute hemorrhage.\n\nOn [**6-28**], an MRI was done which showed expected post-op changes\nbut cannot r/o residual tumor.
