These findings are highly suspicious for\nmetastatic disease (perhaps RCC or melanoma). Correlate with\nbiopsy results and/or CT Torso if warranted. Please see\nsubsequent brain MRI for better evaluation of the smaller\nlesions.\n2) Left orbital enhancing lesion intimately associated with the\nsuperior rectus muscle, likely a metastasis.\n3) No aneurysm or significant stenosis, involving the\nvasculature of the head and neck. Vessels in the right MCA\ndistribution are displaced by the large right temporal mass.\nMinimal bilateral carotid bulb atherosclerotic disease.\n4) Advanced emphysema.\n.\nCT PELVIS and CT Abdomen [**2159-3-2**] 4:13 PM\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:\nMultiple nodules are demonstrated in both lung bases measuring\nup to 24 x 11 mm. Centrilobular emphysema is also identified.\nWithin the liver, multiple hypodense ill-defined lesions are\nidentified, the largest of which is within segment VII of the\nliver and measures 24 x 11 mm, suspicious for metastases.\nMultiple innumerable subcentimeter hypodensities are also seen\ndiffusely throughout the liver, which could represent tiny\nmetastases versus biliary hamartomas. There is no intra- or\nextra- hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The portal vein is\npatent. Within the left adrenal gland, a 22 x 18 mm enhancing\nmass is demonstrated most consistent with metastasis. The right\nadrenal gland is unremarkable. The spleen and pancreas are\nwithin normal limits. The splenic artery is heavily calcified.\nBoth kidneys contain multiple well-circumscribed hypodense\nlesions, many of which appear to be cysts. However, within the\ninferior pole of the left kidney, a 28 x 26 mm hypodense lesion\nappears to demonstrate mild enhancement after contrast\nadministration and is not clearly a simple cyst. Both kidneys\nenhance symmetrically and excrete normally. Proximal ureters are\nunremarkable.\nAbdominal aorta is normal in caliber but demonstrates calcified\natherosclerotic plaque. Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node\nwithin the left periaortic region measuring up to 16 mm wide is\nidentified. There is no free air or free fluid. There is no\nevidence of bowel obstruction.\nMultiple subcutaneous nodules are demonstrated within the\nabdomen and pelvis, the largest of which is within the\nsubcutaneous fat of the right pelvis measuring up to 7 mm.\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Foley catheter is\nseen within the bladder which contains air within it. Coarse\nprostatic calcifications are identified. Small bowel-containing,\nlarge, left inguinal hernia is demonstrated. The bowel appears\nnon-obstructed without evidence of bowel wall thickening. A\nlarge, fat-containing right inguinal hernia is also\ndemonstrated. No inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy is\nidentified. There is no free fluid.\nMultiple small subcutaneous nodules are demonstrated within the\nsubcutaneous fat as well as adjacent to the left gluteus maximus\nmuscle measuring up to 10 mm wide.\nBONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are\nidentified.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Widespread metastatic disease involving the lungs, liver,\nleft adrenal gland, and subcutaneous tissues.\n2. Innumerable subcentimeter hypodense lesions within the liver\nmay represent innumerable tiny metastases versus biliary\nhamartomas.\n3. Multiple hypodense lesions in both kidneys, the majority of\nwhich are cysts. One hypodense lesion in the left kidney,\nhowever, demonstrates mild enhancement and does not meet\ncriteria for simple cyst.\n4. Large, small bowel-containing, left inguinal hernia.\n.\nMR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2159-3-2**] 5:44 PM\nCLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient for postoperative MRI following\nevacuation of right-sided hematoma and evidence of multiple\nmetastasis.\nTECHNIQUE: T1 axial, sagittal and coronal images of the brain\nwere obtained following gadolinium. MP-RAGE axial images were\nalso acquired.\nFINDINGS: There are postoperative changes identified in the\nright frontotemporal region. There is mild mass effect seen on\nthe right lateral ventricle. Multiple hyperintense masses,\nindicating enhancing lesions are identified predominantly in the\nposterior fossa and right cerebral hemisphere. There are at\nleast three enhancing lesions seen in the right cerebellar\nhemisphere, and one in left cerebellar tonsillar region. There\nis a faint area of enhacement in the left side of the pons.\nAdditional 3 small enhancing lesions are seen in the right\noccipital lobe and at least two small enhancing lesions are seen\nin the right frontal lobe. The lesions in the right frontal lobe\nand right cerebellum measure approximately 1 cm in size with an\nadditional 5-10 mm lesion in the right cerebellum. Most of the\nother lesions measure 5 mm or smaller. A faint enhancement is\nalso identified in the left temporal lobe anteriorly which is\nsuggestive of an additional metastasis.\nAt the site of surgery in the right temporal region, some\nmarginal enhancement is identified at the surgical cavity. In\nabsence of pre-gadolinium images, the assessment is limited.\nIMPRESSION: Multiple enhancing lesions are identified for\ntherapy planning in the supra and infratentorial regions as\ndescribed above.\n.\nTEMPORAL LOBE TUMOR (RIGHT)-FS, TEMPORAL LOBE TUMOR (RIGHT)\nProcedure date     Tissue received     Report Date    Diagnosed\nby\n[**2159-3-1**] [**2159-3-2**] [**2159-3-5**] DR.

These\ncytologic features are diagnostic of metastatic melanoma.\nClinical:   Intracranial hemorrhage. Right temporal tumor\nhematoma for evacuation; suspect underlying malignancy.\nGross: The specimen is received fresh labeled with \"[**Known firstname 122**]\n[**Known lastname 72376**]\" and the medical record number.\nPart 1 is additionally labeled \"right temporal lobe tumor,\nfrozen section\" and consists of 3.3 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm aggregate of\nmaroon red recently clotted blood and scant fragments of pink\nwhite tissue.  Intraoperatively, the frozen section diagnosis by\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] reads:\n\"Right temporal lobe tissue:\n    Pigmented malignant epithelioid cell aggregate present\nwithin blood clot. Final diagnosis pending permanent section.\"\nIt is entirely submitted as follows: A = frozen section remnant,\nB-E = remaining tissue.\nPart 2 is additionally labeled \"right temporal lobe tumor\" and\nconsists of an aggregate of red brown blood clot with scant\nfragment of tan tissue, measuring 4.1 x 3.4 x 0.9 cm.  The\nspecimen is entirely submitted in F-J.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 72376**] was emergently taken to the CT scanner after being\nevaluated by the neurology stroke team.  The head CT showed a\nlarge right sided temporal hemorrhage, measuring approximately 5\nx 5 cm with uncal herniation, incipient midline shift,\ntransfalcine herniation. The patient was emergently taken to the\noperating room for decompression. The patient tolerated the\nprocedure well and was extubated POD 1.  Oncology was consulted\nbecause the pathology from the brain mass came back metastatic\nmelanoma.  Their recommendations was CT scan of the chest,\nabdomen and pelvis for metastatic workup, possible role of\ntemodar, and derm consult to look for primary lesion on the\nskin.  The derm consult they recommended a biopsy of the a\nlesion on the foot which turned out to be a dyplastic nevus and\nto get any old records of his possible history of melanoma.  His\nPCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] but she did not have any history of his having\nmelanoma in the past.  On POD 1 he failed bedside swallow\nevaluation so a dobhoff was placed and he was started on\ntubefeeds. His steriods were also started on a taper to 2mg\ndexamethasone [**Hospital1 **]. On POD 2 he went into rapid atrial\nfibrillation so he was started on an amiodarone drip.  On POD 3\nhe was converted to IV amiodarone to PO amiodarone and started\non a beta blocker to rate control him.  He was also started on\nKeppra and the dilantin was continued until he was therapeutic\non his Keppra then it was discontinued.  On POD 4 he was\ntransferred to the floor once his atrial fibrillation was rate\ncontrolled.  He was also seen by radiation oncology who felt\nthat he may be a candidate for radiation but wanted to see the\npost-op MRI before final recommendations.  On POD 5 he pulled\nout his dobhoff and he was re-evaluatated by speech and swallow\nwhich he passed.  He was then able to advance his diet as\ntolerated to a regular diet.  Physical therapy also saw him and\nfelt that he would be better served by going to rehab for at\nleast one week.  On POD 6 it was noted that he had a left\ninguinal hernia so general surgery was consulted and it was\ndecided due to life expectancy and that this is a chronic\nproblem with no signs of obstruction that surgery was not an\nopition at this time. He did need a sitter occasionally but each\nday he has been improving and by POD 7 he was sitter free for\nmore than 24 hours.  He has been neurologically stable and\nawaiting a rehab bed.  On POD#10, he walked in the hallway with\nassistance. His surgical staples are removed without difficulty.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. Atenolol\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
