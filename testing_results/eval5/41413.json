Interval significant decrease in size to right\nretroperitoneal collection likely related to known perforated\nduodenal ulcer with appropriate positioning of indwelling\npigtail catheter. Air remains within the collection indicating\npersistent communication to the bowel.\n2. Persistent moderate right and large left pleural effusion\nresulting in mild right lower lobe atelectasis but complete\ncollapse of the left lower lobe.\n3. Appropriate positioning to GJ tube with tip well past the\nligament of Treitz.\n.\n[**2166-4-26**] KUB: ONE-VIEW ABDOMEN: A GJ tube appears in unchanged\nposition. T-fasteners are noted in the left upper quadrant.\nContrast is seen within several loops of [**Month/Day/Year 499**]. Pigtail catheter\nis noted within the right mid abdomen. There is a large\nleft-sided pleural effusion.\n.\n[**2166-4-21**] Chest CT:IMPRESSION:\n1. Decreased size of air fluid collection suggesting functioning\ndrain, however the persistent oral contrast within the\ncollection indicates sustained perforation.\n2. Organizing multiloculated fluid collection inferior to the\noriginal collection. This will likely respond to conservative\ntreatment and is in a difficult position for percutaneous\ndrainage.\n3. Redemonstration of complex multicystic adnexal tumors.\n4. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than\nright, with compressive atelectasis and likely persistent left\nupper lobe pneumonia. Unchanged small nodules seen in the right\nlung, assessment is incomplete of the left given large pleural\neffusion.\n.\n[**2166-4-21**] Abd/pelvic CT: IMPRESSION:\n1.

Unchanged small nodules seen in the right\nlung, assessment is incomplete of the left given large pleural\neffusion.\n.\n[**2166-4-17**]: PCXR & L lat decub: LUL infiltrate smaller (likely due\nto decreased vascular congestion), L pleural effusion unchanged\nand layers on decubitus film. Small R pleural effusion.\n.\n[**4-13**] R LE Doppler U/S: 1. No evidence of DVT in right common\nfemoral, right superficial femoral and right popliteal vein. The\nright calf veins could not be evaluated on this study due to\ncalf edema.\n2. Edema noted behind the right knee but no focal fluid\ncollections were noted.\n.\n[**4-12**]: CXR: 1. Left suprahilar opacity with interstitial\nthickening is unchanged and may represent pneumonia. However as\nthis has been present since [**2166-3-3**] if this does not\nradiographically resolve, the possibility of a mass should be\nconsidered.\n2. Moderately large left-sided effusion has increased in size.\n.\n[**2166-4-11**] LE Doppler U/S: Negative.\n.\n[**2166-4-11**] CXR: IMPRESSION:\n1. Worsening left upper lobe opacity.\n2. Worsening superimposed interstitial edema and increasing\nbilateral pleural effusions.  Given that the left upper lobe\nopacity has persisted over two months, an underlying malignancy\ncannot be excluded.\n.\n[**2166-4-8**] CXR: FINDINGS: Patient's condition required examination\nin sitting position using AP frontal and left lateral view.  The\npreviously identified tiny apical separation of the pleural\nspace in the left hemithorax, a finding related to the preceding\nsuccessful thoracocentesis, has now disappeared.  A left-sided\nPICC line has changed its position slightly and terminates now\noverlying the SVC at the level of the carina.  The previously\ndescribed pulmonary findings which include a massive density in\nthe left upper lobe area remain rather unchanged.  No\nsignificant increase of pleural effusion is identified.\n.\n[**2166-4-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION:\n1. Decreased left pleural effusion with new small left apical\npneumothorax status post thoracentesis.\n2. Slightly increased right moderate pleural effusion.\n3. Denser more confluent left upper lobe opacity. Differential\nincludes neoplastic or infectious etiologies as described above.\n.\n[**2166-4-4**] CT C/A/P: IMPRESSION:\n1. Duodenal perforation in the second portion, with contrast\nleakage into the large collection in the right retroperitoneum\ndespite catheter terminating within the collection. A catheter\nflush and check is recommended to ensure proper functioning of\nthe drainage catheter.\n2. New mild pneumobilia, thought to represent air dissecting\ncephalad from the duodenum.\n3. Likely reactive ascending colonic wall thickening.\n4. Redemonstration of complex multicystic adnexal tumors,\npossibly slightly decreased in size, ovarian cancer. Interval\nimprovement of peritoneal disease, particularly in the left\nhemi-abdomen.\n5. Enlarging bilateral pleural effusions with compressive\natelectasis.\nPersistent left upper lobe pneumonia.\n6. Stable scattered sub-4-mm nodules in the right lung.\nAssessment incomplete due to presence of pleural effusions.\n7. Complex exophytic hyperdense cyst in the right kidney,\nincompletely characterized. Attention on follow up recommended.\n.\n[**2166-4-3**] CXR: IMPRESSION:\n1. Increased opacification of the left upper lobe, much worse\ncompared to [**2166-3-30**], and only slightly increased compared\nwith [**2166-3-3**].  Probable pneumonia in this\nimmunocompromised patient.\n2. New mild interstitial edema.\n3. New left PICC, tip at mid SVC.\n4. New partial left lower lobe collapse.\n5. Stable small left pleural effusion.\n.\n[**2166-3-31**] CT AB/PELVIS: IMPRESSION:\n1. Large retroperitoneal collection with oral contrast in the\ncavity likely from second and third portion of the duodenum.\nMultiple foci of free intraperitoneal air and moderate amount of\nfree retroperitoneal air.\n2. Bilateral pleural effusions; left greater than right with\nbibasilar atelectasis.\n3. Complex cystic lesion in the adnexa with multiple irregular\nthick septa with interval increase in size compared to prior CT.\nNo clear fat plane between the cystic lesion and the urinary\nbladder.\n4. Complex exophytic hyperattenuated cystic lesion in the right\nkidney, incompletely characterized. Consider renal ultrasound\nfor further evaluation.\n.\n[**2166-3-30**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Minimally improved left upper lobe\npneumonia, could have malignant component.  Unusual organisms,\nsuch as actinomycosis, should be considered.\n.\nOSH CT: (report in OMR from ob gyn admission note from past\n[**2-/2166**] admission): Small L pleural effusion, atelectasis vs.\nscarring in\nRML/lingula, abnormal adnexal region/uterus, 8.5cm irregularly\nshaped cystic focus with nodular enhancing margines in the L\nadnexa. Uterus dieplaced to the R with heterogeneous low level\nechoes in the central portion. Other cystic foci above the\nuterus, may represent thick-walled cysts involving the R ovary.\nSmall loculated pockets of pelvic fluid in bilateral adnexae.\nMildly dilated small bowel loops, distal small bowel\ndecompressed, suspicious for early or partial SBO. Small to mod\namt of diffuse ascites. No peritoneal implants.\n.\nDISCHARGE LABS:\n[**2166-5-5**]: WBC 8.4, Hb 8.2, HCT 25.5, MCV 94, PLT 501.\n[**2166-4-4**]: Retic 0.4%.\n[**2166-5-5**]: Na 137, K 4.6, Cl 99, CO2 36, BUN 10, creat 0.4, glu\n110.\n[**2166-5-5**]: Albumin 1.9, Ca 8.3, Phos 3.2, Mg 1.7.\n[**2166-4-29**]: T bili 0.1, AST/ALT [**12-18**], ALP 85.\n[**2166-4-24**]: Ferritin 388, iron 16, TIBC 105, TRF 81.\n[**2166-3-30**]: Folate 10.2, B12 462.\n[**2166-4-24**]: Chol 85, HDL 21, Trig 74.\n[**2166-4-21**]: CA-125 224.\n[**2166-4-27**]: Vancomycin 21.8.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo woman with ovarian cancer transferred\nfrom the surgical service for febrile neutropenia in the setting\nof bowel perforation secondary to a duodenal ulcer.  The\nperforation occurred one week after starting chemotherapy\n(carboplatin/paclitaxel) for a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer.\nShe was not a surgical candidate, so a drain was placed into the\nintra-abdominal abscess adjacent to the duodenal perforation\nwith the initial plan to keep the drain in place x 6wks.  She\nwas also started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for peritonitis\nand TPN while left NPO.  Oncology consultation recommended\nstarting G-CSF for developing chemo-induced neutropenia and\ntransfer to the Oncology service.  Cultures from the abscess\ndrainage grew coag-negative Staph, Enterococcus, and yeast.  ID\nwas consulted and antibiotics eventually narrowed to\ncipro/metronidazole/vancomycin in addition to fluconazole.\nHypoxemia persisted and a CXR showed a persistent LUL\ninfiltrate, unresolved from a pneumonia treated the month before\nas well as a left pleural effusion.  Concern for unusual\norganisms, resulted in Pulmonary consultaton, repeat CT,\nthoracentesis (1.3L from the left-sided effusion), bronchoscopy,\nand transfer to a negative pressure room for rule out of TB.  A\nPPD with Candidal Ag control were placed and a quantiferon gold\nassay was indeterminate. Bronchoscopy AFB, pleural effusion AFB\nand deaminase were all negative.  Ultimately, the patient ruled\nout for TB with a negative BAL from bronchoscopy and two\nnegative induced sputums.  Pleural effusion cytology was POSTIVE\nFOR ADENOCARCINOMA.  She required a short (two day) stay in the\nICU [**Date range (1) 42061**] for worsening hypoxemia despite furosemide the same\nday after placement of a G-J tube for tube feeding.  She was\ntreatd with further diuresis and lower extremity doppler U/S was\nnegative.  CXR revealed reaccumlation of her left pleural\neffusion and mild right pleural effusion.  Her hypoxemia\nimproved to her previous baseline - 93-94% on 3L O2.  She was\ntransferred back to the hospital floor and remained\nhemodynamicly stable with a stable oxygen requirement of 3L NC.\nHer subsequent course was notable for copious, frequent stools\nin the setting of increasing her tube feeds to their target\nvolume that improved somewhat when the tube feed rate was\ndecreased.  Nutrition was consulted and tube feedings were\nchanged.  Repeat C. difficile toxin assays and PCR were negative\nand she was treated supportively with banana flakes in her tube\nfeeds and loperamide.  Current regimen is ciprofloxacin PO,\nmetronidazole PO, IV vancomycin, and fluconazole PO per ID.\nWork up for recurrent fevers ~ [**2166-4-21**] ultimately revealed that\nher J tube had migrated.  It was replaced and repositioned on\n[**2166-4-25**] with resolution of her fevers.  In the last week of her\nhospitalization, abscess drainage had markedly decreased.\nRepeat abdominal pelvic CT revealed that the drain was in place\nand the abscess was resolving and much decreased in size.\nInterventional radiology was consulted and a pleurex catheter\nwas placed [**2166-4-29**].\n.\n# Febrile neutropenia and infectious disease work up: Fever due\nto retroperitoneal abscess and extravasation of bowel flora into\npatient's abdomen.  She was not a surgical candidate, so\nCT-guided drain into abscess was placed [**2166-3-31**].  Blood cultures\nand C. diff toxin negative.  Coag-negative Staph, Enterococcus,\nand yeast grew in abscess culture.  ID was consulted.\nAntibiotics were narrowed [**2166-4-8**] to cipro, metronidazole,\nvancomycin, and fluconazole.  It is not clear how long abscess\ndrain will need to stay in place and will be dependent on\nfollow-up abdominal/pelvic CT post discharge.  She ruled out for\nTB early in her hospitalization with a negative BAL and 2\nnegative induced sputums.  Pleural fluid culture has been\nnegative, but cytology was POSTIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA.  The\npersistent LUL infiltrate on CXR may be a malignant process\ngiven that it has not resolved on broad spectrum antibiotics and\npulmonary workup has been negative for infection although a\ntissue diagnosis has not been pursued.  Bronchoscopy AFB\nnegative.  Aspergillus galactomannan Ag negative.  Beta glucan\nfalsely elevated by pip/tazo.  Legionella Ag and cryptococcal Ag\nwere negative.  Other cultures as noted above.\n.\n# Perforated bowel and retroperitoneal abscess: Due to a\nduodenal ulcer and H. pylori infection.  No surgical\nintervention at this time.  Drain into abscess placed [**2166-3-31**].\nTPN was converted to tube feeds after G-j tube was placed [**2166-4-11**]\nfor feeding and for perforated ulcer bypass.  IV pantoprazole\n[**Hospital1 **] and abx as above.\nPt developed recurrent fevers on [**2166-4-21**].  CT scan showed\ndevelopment of a new organizing fluid collection.  After D/W\nsurgery and GYN ONC, fistulogram/sinugram to eval for site of\nperforation, which showed that J tube tip had migrated to site\nof perforation.  IR advanced the tube [**2166-4-25**] beyond the point\nof the fluid collection  with placement of [**Doctor Last Name **] to minimize\nrisk of tube migarting again.  Sinugram also showed that\nperforation at mid duodenum-resection would require a Whipple's\nprocedure which pt would not tolerate.  Conservative management\nwas continued.  She will have a repeat CT 10 days after\ndischarge and be seen in surgical follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] (GYN\nONC) for consideration of further management.\n.\n# H. pylori infection: Continue PPI.  Started treatment with\nmetronidazole, amp/sulbactam, and bismuth [**2166-4-27**].\nAmp/sulbactam switched back to ciprofloxicin.  Stool for H.\npylori antigen clearance is pending.\n.\n# Hypoxemia: Repeat CXR showed worsening LUL infiltrate.  Repeat\nCT showed persistent LUL infiltrate, new effusions, and\npulmonary nodules.  Pulmonary consulted.  Thoracentesis [**2166-4-7**]\ndrained 1.3L from left side, complicated by small pneumothorax\nnow resolved.  Effusion cytology positive for malignancy.\nBronchoscopy with BAL was performed on [**2166-4-9**] with negative\ncultures.  The etiology of worsening hypoxemia requiring a brief\n2 day [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission [**Date range (1) 90111**] was likely  multifactorial:\nLUL infiltrate, recent PEs, atelectasis, splinting from right\nabdominal pain s/p J tube placement, recurrent malignant pleural\neffusions.   She ruled out for TB with a negative BAL from\nbronchoscopy and two negative induced sputums on [**4-12**] & [**4-13**].  The\nLUL infiltrate is not clearly infectious and differential\nincludes lymphangitic pulmonary metastases in light of pulmonary\nnodules and recurrent malignant pleural effusion.  Her baseline\noxygenation is stable at ~ 93% on 3 liters O2 nasal cannula.\n.\n# Ovarian cancer: s/p cycle 1 carboplatin/paclitaxel [**2166-3-26**],\nbut held on additional chemo until ulcer/perforation was\nhealing.  Treatment for malignant effusions would be\nchemotherapy, but this was on hold due to her bowel perforation.\nThe patient underwent pleurex catheter placement by\ninterventional pulmonary service on [**2166-4-29**] for recurrent\nmalignant pleural effusion.\n.\n# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Skin breakdown exacerbated by poor\nnutritional status.  Seen by wound team with incorporation of\ntheir recommendations.  Wound team reconsulted for further\nrecommendations prior to discharge.\n.\n# Lower extremity edema: Lower extremity doppler U/S negative\nfor DVT. Exacerbated by poor nutrition.  Treated with elevation\nand intermittant diuresis.\n.\n# Thrush: Nystatin swish and spit temporarily given in addition\nto the fluconazole.\n.\n# Neutropenia: Chemo-induced.

An abdominal\nabscess formed from the perforation and needed a drain placed to\nhelp clear the infection along with IV antibiotics and G-CSF\n(Neupogen), a medication to help produce white blood cells, as\nyour white blood cell count was initially very low due to\nchemotherapy.  While the ulcer was healing, you were fed with\nhigh calorie fluids (TPN) through the vein and then through a\nJ-tube placed in your small intestine.  The tube feedings caused\nyou to have diarrhea that was treated by changing the type of\nfeedings, adding banana flakes, and occasionally using\nanti-diarrhea medicine after tests showed the diarrhea was not\ninfectious.  The J-tube was also repositioned and secured in\nplace after it had moved.\n.\nA CXR and CT scan of the chest both showed that the pneumonia\nfrom your last admission had not cleared and you had fluid\naround the lungs.  This fluid (pleural effusion) was drained\n[**2166-4-7**] and [**2166-4-21**]. Tests of the fluid showed that it has\ncancer cells in it.  You also had a bronchoscopy of your lungs\nthat did not show evidence of infection.  Because the fluid came\nback after drainage, you had a pleurex catheter placed [**2166-4-29**].\n.\nYou were continued on your enoxaparin (Lovenox) for blood clots\nin the lungs (pulmonary emboli), identified on your last\nadmission.  The enoxaparin was held when procedures were\nnecessary (bronchoscopy, pleuracentesis, PICC line placement,\npleurex catheter placement, J-tube placement, placement of\nabcsess drain) and then restarted as soon as possible.\n.\nYou will need to remain on antibiotics until the abscess and\nulcer resolve, as determined by future CT scans (ideally with\noral gastrograffin to evaluate the ulcer perforation; contrast\nthrough the J-tube will not reach this location).  These\nantibiotics will also treat the H. pylori infection, a bacteria\nthat often causes ulcers.  While you were in the hospital, you\ndeveloped thrush and were temporarily treated with nystatin\nswish and spit.  Fluconazole still given for yeast in the\nabscess also treats thrush.\n.\nMEDICATION CHANGES:\n1.
