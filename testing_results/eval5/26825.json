The\nmass grew larger, to the size of a baseball. It appears that FNA\nwas performed but was non-diagnostic (probably because\nanaplastic tumors tend to be necrotic). The mass appears to be\ncystic in nature and has been aspirated at least 3 times, which\ndecrease in size each time. Now size is 6.5cm*6.5cm. Plan for\nsurgery in [**Month (only) **] was deferred [**3-7**] syncope and pacer placement for\nSSS; again deferred 2 weeks ago [**3-7**] URI; was planned for surgery\nthis Thurday.\n.\nPt was o/w in his USOH until 2-3 weeks ago when he developed a\nURI with symptoms of dry cough; no fever, chills, sore throat,\nmyalgias. Pt was treated with 3 days of an antibiotics, followed\nby a 10 day course of levaquin (completed 2 days PTA). Per pt\nand son, no [**Name2 (NI) 66025**] pna. 2 days prior to admission, pt\ndeveloped hemoptysis; states he coughed up 4 tsp of blood. 1 day\nPTA, pt developed stridorous breathing and respiratory distress.\nPt was initially seen at [**Hospital1 **], where he was given steroids,\nwith improvement in respiratory status. Pt was transferred to\n[**Hospital6 2561**], where his surgeon is located. There he\nwas admitted to the MICU. Thyroid cyst was aspirated with\nremoval of 300cc of fluid. Pt was given racemic epinephrine and\nDecadron 10mg IV x1. CT neck showed tracheal mass per nursing\ns/o (pt brought CT).\n.\nPt now breathing more comfortably. He has not had fever and\nnight sweats but reports weakness and weight loss for several\nmonths recently.\n\nPast Medical History:\nR thyroid cyst (as above)\nGoiter\nCRI\nHTN\nSSS (s/p pacer [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66026**])\nprostate cancer -dx 10 years ago; received monthly shots which\nwere discontinued recently.\nanemia\nAfib (19 episodes since [**2119-11-4**], as documented on pacer\ninterogation [**2120-3-6**])\n\n\nSocial History:\nWas living alone in ALF. Walks with walker. Able to take care of\nhimself; home health aide visits once a week. Denies history of\ntobacco, etoh, drugs. Used to work as hat manufacturer.\n\nFamily History:\nNo history of thyroid disease. Sister with lung ca. Brother with\ngastric ca. sister with unknown ca. Father with stroke.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVS: T 99.4, BP 119/59, HR 76, RR 18, 99%RA\nGen: NAD\nHEENT: PERRL, EOMI, clear OP, MMM\nNeck: Large ~6 x 6 cm sized right thyroid mass, soft, possibly\ncystic, non-tender. L lobe of the thyroid gland also prominent.\n\nCVS: RRR, nl s1 s2, no m/g/r\nLungs: transmitted upper airway stridor; otherwise clear\nAbd: soft, NT, ND, +BS\nExt: no edema\nNeuro: CN 2-12 intact, [**6-7**] bilateral upper and lower extremity\nstrength.\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nCT Neck-IMPRESSION:\n1. 7-cm diameter right neck mass, with direct invasion of the\nsubglottic, cervical and proximal thoracic trachea. The mass is\nreportedly thyroid in origin. Differential diagnosis includes\nprimary head/neck cancer and lymphoma.\n2. Left lobe thyroid enlargement with heterogeneous appearance.\n3. Right upper paratracheal and prevascular lymphadenopathy as\nwell as additional nodes in the right side of the neck.\nDedicated MR of the neck may be helpful for more complete\nassessment of the neck mass and lymphadenopathy if warranted\nclinically.\n.\nPathology: The tumor is composed of a relatively monotonous\nproliferation of spindle cells which grow in sheets with a\nprominent vascular pattern.  Immunostains for cytokeratin AE1/3\nand CAM 5.2, CD-68, CD-79a, CD-138, S-100, LCA absorbed CEA,\nEMA, CD34, CD31, TTF-1, actin, desmin, MNF-116, calcitonin, and\nthyroglobulin are negative.  These results exclude both melanoma\nand hematopoietic neoplasms.  The differential diagnosis\nincludes, but is not limited to, sarcoma, spindle cell\ncarcinomas (sarcomatoid carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive\ntract and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma), and malignant salivary\ngland neoplasms.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt was transferred here for further mgmt of airway and large\nthyroid mass by our IP team. IP found endotracheal obstructing\ntumor and extrinsic\ncompression of the high trachea by thyroid mass. After rigid\nbronchoscopy with removal of the intratracheal tumor component\non [**2120-3-26**], stat pathology showed anaplastic tumor. He was\ntranferred to the MICU. Subsequently extubated and his\nrespiratory Sx are now improved. Pt was seen by Rad Onc, who\nrecommended transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for XRT.  On the morning\nof possible radiation, patient and family met with\ninterventional pulmonary team who explained that the most recent\nCT showed further invasion of the tumor into the trachea.  After\na long discussion, patient and family asked to be made CMO.\nPatient was started on morphine drip and palliative care team\nwas consulted with recommendations to ensure comfort. Mr.\n[**Known lastname 66027**] died approximately 24 hours after decision to be CMO,\non [**2120-4-2**].\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nNC\n\nDischarge Condition:\nNC\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nNC\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nNC\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2120-4-7**]",
