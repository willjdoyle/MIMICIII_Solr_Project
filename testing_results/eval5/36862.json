It measures approximately\n3.5 x 2.8 cm. An MRI with [**Date Range **] would be better in further\nevaluation. There are no other lesions or masses. There is\nsignificant mass effect causing left sulcal effacement and\ncompression of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.\nThere is a 7.6 mm rightward subfalcine herniation. There is no\nevidence of hydrocephalus or ventricular entrapment. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]\nand white matter differentiation in remainder of the brain is\nmaintained. The osseous and soft tissue structures are\nunremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: Left frontal lobe poorly defined mass with vasogenic\nedema and 7.6 mm rightward subfalcine herniation. Findings are\nconcerning for a primary glial neoplasm and further correlation\nwith MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is recommended.\n\nMR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2116-8-27**]:\nFINDINGS: As seen on the recent CT examination, there is a mass\nidentified in the left frontal lobe region. The mass\ndemonstrates irregular shape and\nmeasures approximately 4 cm in size. Following [**Month/Day/Year **],\nirregular areas of enhancement are seen with rim enhancement in\nthe components of the mass. The mass extends from the left\nfrontal lobe region to the subcortical region. Extensive\nsurrounding edema is seen with mass effect on the left lateral\nventricle and midline shift. No restricted diffusion seen within\nthe mass. There are no other areas of abnormal enhancement\nidentified within the brain. Few scattered foci of T2\nhyperintensity are seen in the brain.\nIMPRESSION: Large, approximately 4 cm mass in the left frontal\nlobe with rim enhancement and surrounding edema with midline\nshift and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle. Foci of low\nsignal on susceptibility images in the mass indicate prior\nhemorrhage. The appearances of the mass are suggestive of a\nprimary neoplasms such as a glioma. There is no hydrocephalus or\nacute infarct seen.\nPFI: Left frontal lobe mass with surrounding edema and midline\nshift. The\nappearances are suggestive of a primary brain neoplasm such as\nglioma.\n\nCardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2116-8-28**]  12:28:30 PM\nSinus rhythm. Normal tracing. No previous tracing available for\ncomparison.  Intervals Axes\nRate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T\n71 142 74 396/415 60 52 50\n\nRadiology Report MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2116-8-28**]\n7:14 AM\nIMPRESSION: Unchanged left frontal mass lesion with persistent\neffacement of the sulci and mass effect. The functional MRI\ndemonstrated the expected activation areas during the movement\nof the hand and feet, language and also movement of tongue at\nmore than 1 cm from the lesion.\n\nFinal Report CT TORSO WITH CONTRAST [**2116-8-28**] 5:33 PM\nFINDINGS: CT CHEST: There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal\nlymphadenopathy. The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.\nThere is no pericardial or pleural effusion. The lungs are\nclear. The airways are patent to the subsegmental level. There\nis no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN: The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands,\nkidneys, and liver are unremarkable. There is focal fatty\ninfiltration adjacent to the\nligamentum teres (3, 54). Minimal gallbladder wall thickening is\nlikely\nattributable to adenomyomatosis. There is no mesenteric or\nretroperitoneal\nlymphadenopathy. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. The small\nbowel loops are normal in caliber and without focal wall\nthickening. There is no evidence of free air or free fluid.\nCT OF THE PELVIS: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder is\nunremarkable. The\nuterus is unremarkable. Multiple dilated veins along the left\npelvic side\nwall, including the left gonadal vein is noted (3, 104). There\nis no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.\nBONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions\nidentified.\nIMPRESSION: 1. No CT evidence of primary malignant tumor or\ndistant metastases. 2. Prominent pelvic veins along the left\npelvic sidewall and dilated left gonadal vein, a frequent\nincidental finding. However, in the setting of chronic pelvic\npain, the appearance can sometimes reflect pelvic congestion\nsyndrome.\n\nPathology Report\nProcedure Date [**2116-8-31**], Report Date [**2116-9-1**]\nDIAGNOSIS:\n  I.  Left frontal tumor is frozen section #1 (A-B):\nNecrotic tissue with rare atypical cells.\n II.  Left frontal tumor for frozen section #2 (C-D):\nMalignant neoplasm consistent with glioma.\nIII.  Left frontal tumor for permanent section (E-H):\nGlioblastoma (WHO grade IV), See Note.\nNote:  Severe cytologic atypia, numerous and atypical mitotic\nfigures, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis (extensive)\nare seen.\n\nHEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**2116-8-31**]: There has been interval\nleft frontal craniectomy and excision of a previously 3.5-cm\nmass in the left frontal lobe. There is expected pneumocephalus.\nAlthough the degree of vasogenic edema is similar, there has\nbeen a decrease in the degree of shift of midline structures,\npreviously 10 mm shift to the right, and now 5 mm shift to the\nright (2:15). There is again compression of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of\nthe left lateral ventricle, but this appears somewhat less\nsevere than in the prior study. The right lateral ventricle\ndemonstrates improvement in the degree of mass effect. There has\nbeen no interval development of hydrocephalus, and the basal\ncisterns appear intact. There is no evidence of transtentorial\nherniation. The small amount of hemorrhage in the postoperative\nbed is expected. There is overlying subgaleal hematoma, and the\ncraniectomy site is well opposed. The visualized paranasal\nsinuses and remainder of soft tissues appear unremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: Expected appearance following resection of left\nfrontal lobe\nmass, with continued, but somewhat decreased mass effect and\nright shift of midline structures.\n\n\nMRI [**2116-9-1**]:\nFINDINGS: The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy and\nresection of a previously identified neoplastic process\ninvolving the left frontal lobe, there is evidence of residual\nblood products within the surgical area, persistent and\nunchanged vasogenic edema and mild mass effect along the sulci\nin the right frontal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. After administration of\n[**Doctor Last Name **] contrast, there is no evidence of significant\nabnormal enhancement, however, possibly it is too early to\ndiscriminate abnormal enhancement, correlation with a followup\nMRI once the blood product has been reabsorbed, is recommended\nfor further assessment. On the axial T2-weighted sequence, the\narterial flow voids, demonstrates a possible vascular loop at\nthe junction of the left A1 segment, and the anterior\ncommunicating artery (5:11), formally a small aneurysm cannot be\ncompletely excluded, followup with MRA is recommended. The\nvisualized paranasal sinuses are normal as well as the orbits,\nthere is evidence of patchy opacities at the mastoid air cells\nbilaterally.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. The patient is status post left frontal mass resection and\nleft frontal craniotomy, there is persistent vasogenic edema,\nblood products in the surgical bed.\n2. The previously described left frontal lobe mass lesion\napparently has been resected, and the blood at the surgical\ncavity obscures the pattern of enhancement, followup after the\nreabsorption of the blood products is\nrecommended.\n3. Possible prominent vascular loop versus a small aneurysm is\nidentified at the junction of the A1 and anterior communicating\nsegment on the left.\n\nCTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS([**9-2**]):\nOn non-contrast, decreasing pneumocephalus, otherwise unchanged\npost-left-\nfrontal-mass resection appearance; no new hemorrhage. On CTA, no\naneurysm or vascular occlusion. Area at the A1 segment\nbifurcation with acomm not aneurysm, likely infandibulum\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**2116-8-27**]\nafter her CT scan revealed a new brain mass in the left frontal\nlobe. She was started on steroids for the large amount of edema\nsurrounding the mass as well as dilantin for seizure\nprophylaxis. Her MRI of the brain revealved irregular areas of\nenhancement with rim enhancement in components of the mass. The\nwas also mass effect on the left lateral ventricle. On [**2116-8-28**]\nthe patient had a functional MRI in preparation for surgery.\n\nShe went to the OR for tumor resection on [**8-31**]. The patient\ntolerated the procedure well and the procedure was without\ncomplications. The patient went to the ICU post-operatively for\nQ 1 hour neuro checks. Her neuro exam was stable\npost-operatively. Physical therapy evaluated her and felt that\nshe was safe to ambulate on her own and did not require any\nadditional visits. She was tranferred to the neurosurgical floor\non [**9-1**].\n\nHer MRI showed a gross total resection however there was a\nquestion of a small aneurysm seen at the junction of the ACOMM\nat A1 on the left. Therefore the patient had a CTA to further\nevaulate this on [**9-2**]. The CTA showed that this area of concern\nto be an infandibulum and not an aneurysm. Occupational therapy\nevaluated the patient on [**9-2**] and felt that she would benefit\nfrom outpatient therapy to assist with cognitive training. The\nfinal pathology for the mass was Glioblastoma - WHO grade IV.\nShe was ultimately discharged to home as above([**9-3**]), with\nfollow up scheduled in the brain tumor clinic.  The patient\nremained neurologically intact at the time of discharge.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
