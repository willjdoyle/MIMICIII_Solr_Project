There was concern for\nleptomeningeal disease, and a lumbar puncture was performed to\nevaluate for leptomeningeal disease, which was noted to have a\nhigh opening pressure of 27, but without positive cytology or\nsuggestive chemistries.  Therefore, he was subsequently\nevaluated by neurosurgery and brain tumor resection was\nperformed.\nPt was taken to the OR [**6-19**] electiveley where under general\nanesthesia he underwent right occipital craniotomy with excision\nof metastatic lesion. He tolerated this well and was transferred\nto the PACU overnight for close neurologic monitoring.  He\nremained stable and was transferred to the floor. Diet and\nactivity were advanced without difficulty.  Wound was clean ,\ndry and intact. He was transferred back to Omed [**6-21**].  He was\nalso started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis after his\nsurgery was performed.  He was never noted to have seizures\nduring his hospital course, continuation of Dilantin and/or\nlevel monitoring was to be performed at a follow up appointment\nwith neurooncology. The pathology indicated likely colonic\nadenocarcinoma.  His headached were well controlled on\ndecadrone, and he was continued on his dilantin, to follow up in\n[**Hospital 20891**] clinic for monitoring.  His treatment plan was to\ninclude radiation therapy, he was discharged with follow up with\n[**Hospital1 18**] radiation treatment.\n\n# PE- He was noted to have a  small 1 vessel, segmental thrombus\nnoted on CT thorax.  This was confirmed on a dedicated CTA of\nchest, he had negative LENIs and was clinically asymptomatic\nwithout no ekg changes. A IVC filter was placed for prophylaxis.\n As his left porta cath had no drawback, and on history was\nnoted to have neck pain a few weeks prior, his left upper\nextremity was dopplered and demonstrated an upper extremity\nclot.  He was not systemically anticoagulated, and this was to\nbe discussed at a future oncological appointment, as the risk of\nbleed was thought greater than that of a PE.\n\n# Colon CA-s/p resection, adjuvant chemo FOLFOX+avastin . He was\nfound to have a brain metastasis on this admission.  His\nheadache was well controlled with steroids and narcotics, and\nnausea controlled with antiemetics.
