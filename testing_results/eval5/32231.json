Pateint reports she awoke on\nSaturday at 2-3am not feeling herself with increased SOB,\northopnea, and LE edema, associated with cough and mild chest\npain with coughing but none at rest or with exertion. Cough is\nrarely productive of white sputum and she has noted wheezing as\nwell but no fever or chills. She has significant orthopnea to\nthe point where she has been sleeping in a recliner. Report\nsymptoms dissimilar from previous episodes where she has had to\nhave pericardial effusions drained.\n.\nAt [**Hospital1 **], she was initially hypoxic and required bipap. She\ndiuresed quite well with lasix and was weaned down to 3L NC. She\nwas transferred here as her oncologic care is here. She also had\na head CT with brain mets and vasogenic edema (although\nimproved) as below so decadron dosng was increased to [**Hospital1 **].\nCurrently, she reports that her breathing and edema are much\nimproved although not yet back to her baseline. Her chest pain\nhas improved. ROS is remarkable for right sided facial droop\nover the last week and left sided headache. Denies N/V, visual\nchanges. Has also had hoarse voice x 2 months. Also reports\nright arm numbness related to an IV placed several months ago.\nROS otherwise negative in detail.\n\nPast Medical History:\nPast Medical Hx:\n1. Metastatic breast cancer: Oncology History: Initially\ndiagnosed in [**1-29**] when she found a breast mass in her left\nbreast. Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated tumor,\nER/PR/Her2neu all negative, underwent\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy, and subsequently bilateral mastectomy\nwith reconstruction in [**7-29**], and subsequently with radiation\npost operatively. She was then diagnosed in [**11-28**] with brain\nmetastases, and underwent whole brain radiation. MRI completed\nin [**1-30**] showed increased size of her brain mets. She was also\ndiagnosed in [**1-30**] with a malignant pericardial effusion when she\npresented with tamponade, and was admitted to the CCU. She was\nstarted on xeloda and avastin, which were stopped when liver\nmets were seen on imaging. At that time, she was started on\nadriamycin. She again developed a pericardial effusion which was\ndrained in the cath lab in [**3-30**]. After that, her adriamycin was\nswitched to navelbine. She also developed a malignant pleural\neffusion which was drained.\n.\n\nSocial History:\nLives with husband, works as a program coordinator for WGBH. H/o\ncigarettes one-half to one pack per day x 10 years, quite appx\n[**2173**]. ETOH or drugs - none. She also has a son who is now 21.\n\n\nFamily History:\nThere is no family history of breast cancer. There is a paternal\ngrandmother who had colon cancer and maternal grandfather who\nmight have had prostate or colon cancer. The patient has no\nsiblings.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVitals: T 97.2 BP 129/82 P 124 R 24 98% 3L NC\nGen: chronically ill appearing female, speaking in half\nsentences due to dyspnea but not in acute distress\nHEENT: MMM.

No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,\ncavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal\n(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are\nnormal. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with\ntrivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic\npressure could not be determined. There is a small pericardial\neffusion (?loculated). There are no echocardiographic signs of\ntamponade. There is significant, accentuated respiratory\nvariation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with\nimpaired ventricular filling. Pericardial constriction cannot be\nexcluded.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-4-22**], no\nchange. If indicated, a cardiac MRI or CT may be better to\nassess for pericardial constriction/pericardial thickness.\n.\n[**Year (4 digits) 706**]:\nCXR [**5-22**]:\nFINDINGS: Comparison is made to [**2186-5-17**], and multiple priors.\nLung volumes remain very low, but allowing for this,\ncardiomediastinal\ncontours appear unchanged. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural\neffusions are not significantly changed, right greater than\nleft. Known pleural and\nparenchymal metastases are not well visualized by radiographs,\nbetter\ndemonstrated on recent CT of [**2186-4-19**].\n.\nCTA Chest:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence pulmonary embolus.\n2. New right lower lobe consolidative opacity consistent with\npneumonia.\n3. Bilateral pleural effusions (increased on left) and\npersistent pericardial effusion.\n4. No short interval change in widespread metastatic disease.\n.\nCT Head:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.\n2. Slightly increased amount of vasogenic edema compared to\nprior MR,\nhowever, difficult to assess due to difference in techniques. If\ndirect\ncomparison is required, consider repeating MR.\n.\nCRX [**6-9**]\nMild pulmonary edema has worsened, left lower lobe is\nchronically collapsed, no appreciable right pleural effusion,\npigtail pleural drain still in place, small left pleural\neffusion stable, heart size is normal. Since the chin is down,\ntip of the endotracheal tube less than 15 mm from the carina is\nacceptable. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of\nview.\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nIn short, Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 40F w metastatic breast cancer and\nmalignant pleural effusions, admitted with shortness of breath,\ntransferred to the ICU in the setting of seizure and PEA arrest.\n\n# Dyspnea/Respiratory failure: Dyspnea felt to be multifactorial\nand related to reaccumulation of large R sided pleural effusion,\ndocumented as malignant in [**2186-3-22**]. CT chest on admission\nshowed increase pleural effusions with large loculated right\neffusion. IP evaluated her and performed a thoracentesis on\n[**2186-5-23**]. Her symptoms improved with this procedure as well as\nwith diuresis prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. She was continued on\nLasix 40mg PO BID for component of heart failure as well given\nassociation with lower extremity edema. TTE was obtained which\nshowed EF of 55-60% and no change since prior [**2186-4-22**]. In the\n[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she had IP place a pig tail chest catheter placed to drain\nher infusion. She required intubation with her PEA arrest\nadvent. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was repeatedly attempted to wean from\nthe ventilator on a daily basis. She had a attempted extubation\nbut quickly became too tachypneic and required reintubation. She\nlater that day self-extubated and again required reintubation.\nShe was diagnosed with a HAP MSSA PNA and was treated with a\ncourse of vanco and Zosyn initially and then continued on Zosyn.\nSignificant effort was made to diuresis the patient to improve\nher chance of extubation, but despite this she continued to fail\nrepeat spontaneous breathing trials due to poor tidal volumes\nand tachypnea. Despite aggressive and repeated treatment of\npneumonia, pleural effusion, volume overload, daily\nwake-ups/SBTs the patient was unable to been weaned from the\nventilator.  During her last week of the hospital stay, her\nweaning difficulty was further complicated by a decline in\nmental status which likely reflected a neurologic complication\nof the intra-cranial tumor (see below). Thus, despite\naggreessive and repeated attempts toward extubation, she\nremained intubated until expiration.  Please note also that the\nextended period of time with intubation instead of moving toward\na tracheostomy or change in the goals of care reflected the\nwishes of the husband.  After she had been intubated for over 2\nweeks and it was clear that this was not improving despite\naggressive attempts toward extubation, the situation was\ndiscussed extensively with the husband.  We had proposed either\ntracheostomy and long-term care or pursuing palliative care\n(extubation, comfort care).  The husband did not want either\npathway and held out hope that she would come of the ventilator.\n Thus, patient remained on mechanical ventilation for extended\nperiod of time.\n.\n# Metastatic breast cancer: Patient has widely metastatic breast\ncancer including brain, liver, and pleural fluid mets with poor\nprognosis. This was reinforced with patient by primary\noncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] but she wishes to maintain an aggressive\napproach to care. She was continued on home Decadron 8mg daily\nas well as Keppra and dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.\nMalignant pleural and pericardial effusions addressed as above.\nPalliative care was consulted and recommended starting Dilaudid\nfor pain control which was done. On night of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]\nshe had a witnessed seizure event followed by PEA arrest\nrequiring <1 minute of CPR. Then had agonal breaths requiring\nintubation (see above for resp course). Her anti-seizure\nmedications were increased, however, her dilantin level was very\nlabile during her admission due to concern about PO absorption.\n3 days prior to expiration she was changed to IV dilantin. Five\ndays prior to expiation she had a change in mental status and\nbecame less responsive. There was concern that she had a\nprogression of her brain mets or had a CVA. Despite medical\nadvise of a head CT to evaluate the patient, her husband refused\nthis procedure. See below for day of expiration events.\n\n# Facial droop: Pt reported a new facial droop and had facial\nweakness with peripheral Bell's palsy on exam. She had\npreviously discussed this with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] and plan was to obtain\nfurther imaging, however, it was decided that it would not\nchange management since neurosurgeon would not consider her a\nsurgical candidate. Neurooncology was following and recommended\npalliative care.\n\n# Social Family issues: During the pt??????[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 153**] stay there had been\nconcern over the husband??????s interactions with the staff. He had\nexpressed some paranoia and distress over the care of his wife.\nThere had been repeat family meetings with the husband and the\nattending to listen to his concerns and explain her course. He\nwas very concerned that she was still requiring intubation.\nThere had been daily efforts to try to wean the vent, but had\nbeen unsuccessful. The husband wanted transfer of his wife to\n[**Name (NI) **], but there was not an accepting physician available\nthere. Attending had a family meeting with ethics on [**6-8**] to\ndiscuss options of further pt care. Pt??????s husband had [**Name2 (NI) 75353**] to\nconsider hospice, but was still unsure. Today after death of\npatient, husband expressed his appreciation to the staff.\n\nDuring the final week of the [**Hospital **] hospital course, the patient's\nmental status appeared depressed, and we were concerned for a\nneurologic complication.  Given that the patient had\nintracranial tumor, the differential including bleeding into\nthat area, edema, expansion, early herniation - to determine\nthis, we attempted to perform a head CT scan but the husband\nrefused for the reason that he felt it would not change her\nmanagement.  We attempted this a couple times but he refused.\nHe also began to refuse simple procedures such as a PICC line\nfor access as the patient was running out of adequate access for\nmedications.  On the day of the patient's death (see event\nbelow), it appeared that she had a neurologic catastrophe.\nThus, our suspicions that the patient had a complication related\nto the intra-cranial tumor at the beginning of the week were\nlikely accurate.  Whatever process had evolved likely then lead\nto complete neurologic catastrophe on the final day of the\nhospital course likely reflective of brain herniation given the\nneurologic examination revealing fixed, dilated pupils with no\ncorneal reflexes and no response to any stimuli (verbal,\npainful).\n\nEvents of expiration:\n11:30 AM, pt's SBP dropped suddenly to 43. She was given IVF\nbolus and Epi 0.2mg. SBP up to 200s briefly, then in 100s, and\ntachy to 140s. Pulse was still present. Neuro exam showed mildly\ndilated and fixed pupils. No gag reflex, no response to painful\nstimuli, no limb movement, no corneal reflex, and eyes did not\nmove with dolls head maneuver. Pts husband was notified and no\nother heroic measures were indicated. SBP then slowly declined\nover the morning. Attending was present.\n\nAt 1340 pt had PEA arrest. Ventilator was stopped. Pt has no\nheart beat or pulse. Was warm. Pupils fixed and dilated. No\nresponse to pain. Time of death 1340, family at bedside. Husband\ndeclined autopsy. Admitted and attending notified. Cause of\ndeath was metastatic breast cancer with immediate cause\nneurologic catastrophe likely secondary to complication of\nintracranial mass.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications at [**Hospital1 **]:\ndecadron 8 mg [**Hospital1 **] (increased from 8mg daily home dose)\nkeppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nprotonix 40 mg daily\ndilantin extended release 200 mg qhs\ndilaudid 1 mg IV q4h prn\nzofran 4 mg IV q4h prn\n.\nHome Medications\nAlso on metoprolol XL 50 mg daily\n\nDischarge Medications:\nnone\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nMetastatic Breast cancer\nCardiac arrest\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nexpired\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nnone\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nnone\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2186-6-10**]",
