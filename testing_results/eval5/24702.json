The pt reports that about six weeks ago she started to\nhave some hives over her arms and then developed severe pain in\nher arms. Her w/u at [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 1474**] was negative and she\ndecided to have \"shots\" into her spine, done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 62314**] in\n[**Location (un) 2498**]. The initial injection brought her relief, however she\nalso developed some numbness in her finger tips. She then had\nher 2nd injection and started to feel unbalanced afterwards,\nleaning more to the left. She fell once. Then she had her 3rd\ninjection and immediately afterward fell again. In between the\ninjections she also started to note weakness in her legs and new\nonset ptosis of her R eye with double vision. She saw a\nneurologist who attributed it to \"bell's palsy\". She denies any\nincontinence of stool or urine.  She states she has lost 37\npounds over the past 2 months.\n.\nROS: negative for CP, SOB, abdominal pain, diarrhea,\nconstipation, f/c/ns, dysuria, changes in the color of the urine\nor stool, n/v/ bowel or bladder incontinence, palpitations.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vitals 98.1, 76, 151/57, 18, 98% on RA, the\npt was seen by ortho spine.

Signal abnormality within the T7 vertebral body with\nenhancing component extending into the epidural space at this\nlevel concerning for a neoplastic process. Probable abnormal\nsignal is seen within the cord at this level suggestive of\nedema. 2. Probable area of signal abnormality within the pons\nappears to be demonstrated on limited views, that in retrospect\nappears to be confirmed on the dedicated MRI brain. It is likely\nan area of chronic infarction.\n.\n[**2101-1-2**] CT TORSO W/ CONTRAST\n1. No paraaortic masses present.\n2. Large prevascular and pretracheal lymph nodes, concerning for\nmalignancy as described above. Clinical correlaion is\nrecommended.\n.\n[**2101-1-3**] MRI HEAD\nFindings. There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses,\nmass effect, or infarction. There are periventricular white\nmatter hyperintensities suggesting chronic small vessel\nischemia. There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast\nadministration. Conclusion: Chronic small vessel ischemic\nchanges, otherwise normal study.\n.\n[**2101-1-7**] BONE SCAN\n1. Focal increased abnormal uptake in the T7 vertebral body\nconsistent with\nosseous metastasis. 2. Atrophic right kidney. 3. Degenerative\nchange as\nabove.\n.\n[**2101-1-12**] MRI HEAD\nFINDINGS: Since prior exam, there has been no significant\ninterval change. No new intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus,\nshift of normally midline structures, minor or major [**Month/Day/Year 1106**]\nterritorial infarct is apparent. Stable appearance of the\nmultiple T2 hyperintense foci in the periventricular white\nmatter suggestive of chronic microvascular infarcts, as well as\nthe solitary left paracentral pontine lesion, also probably a\nchronic lacunar infarct, are both observed. Following\nintravenous contrast administration, no abnormal enhancement is\nnoted. IMPRESSION: No significant interval change from the prior\nstudy, without clear indication as to the cause of the right\nsided ptosis. As was discussed today ([**2101-1-14**]) with the house\nstaff, follow-up dedicated imaging of the orbits and cavernous\nsinuses, as well as MR angiography, could be helpful.\n.\n[**2101-1-13**] T7 BONE/TISSUE BIOPSY\n1. T7 bone biopsy #1 (A-B): Malignant neoplasm, most likely\ncarcinoma.\n2. T7 bone biopsy #2 (C-D): Malignant neoplasm, most likely\ncarcinoma.\n3. Epidermal soft tissue (E-F): Malignant neoplasm, most likely\ncarcinoma.\n4. Bone tissue tumor (G-H): Malignant neoplasm, most likely\ncarcinoma.\nNote:  Immunohistochemical studies for keratin AE1/AE1, CAM 5.2,\nand chromogranin show focal immunoreactivity.  No\nimmunoreactivity is seen with LCA, synaptophysin, or TTF-1.\nAdditional stains will be performed, and reported in an\naddendum.\n.\n[**2101-1-14**] T7 MASS BIOPSY FLOW CYTOMETRY\nNon-diagnostic study.  Cell marker analysis was performed but\nwas non-contributory in this case due to insufficient number of\nlymphoid cells for analysis.\n.\n[**2101-1-16**] LUE U/S\nLeft cephalic vein thrombosis at antecubital fossa. The\nremainder of the veins of left upper extremity are unremarkable.\n.\n[**2101-1-17**] SKELETAL SURVEY\nThe patient has a known T7 lesion. There are bilateral spinal\nrods and a right IJ line as well as skin staples. Metallic\ndensities overlie two disc levels in the mid thoracic spine.\nLucency in this area are presumably relates to the site of\nrecent surgery. Fine assessment of bony detail somewhat limited\nby high-contrast technique. Some scattered [**Month/Day/Year 1106**]\ncalcification and clips are seen anterior to the lumbar spine.\nThere are mild degenerative changes and more pronounced facet\narthrosis in the lumbar spine. Vertebral body heights are\npreserved throughout the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine.\nAdditional clips are seen in the abdomen. Prominent facet\narthrosis is seen at the lumbosacral junction. Irregular density\nadjacent to the left SI joint is noted. If this does not\nrepresent a bone graft donor site, then further evaluation for\nbony lesion would be recommended. There are moderate- to\nmoderately-severe degenerative changes involving both hips.\nClips are seen over the right inguinal area. Probable mild\ndegenerative changes in the right and to a greater extent left\nknee. Surgical clips noted along the right inner thigh. With the\nexception of known areas in the thoracic spine, no focal lytic\nlesion is identified on this skeletal survey. Degenerative\nchanges in the lower lumbar spine and hips noted.\n.\n[**2101-1-25**] PET-CT\n1. Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy with focal abnormal\nuptake\nof FDG with a 2.3 cm prevascular node with SUV of 15, and a 1 cm\nprecarinal node with SUV 16. Focal FDG uptake in bilateral hila.\n2. Destructive bone lesion at T7 with SUV 12, and postoperative\nchanges of the thoracic spine. 3. Focal uptake in rectum.\nDigintal exam is recommended. 4. Focal FDG uptake toward the\npelvis of the atrophic right kidney with SUV of 7.9, probably\ndue to excretion.\n.\n[**2101-1-27**] T-L AP AND LATERAL SPINE XRAY\nPosterior thoracic spinal fusion without hardware loosening.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMrs. [**Known lastname 7046**] is a 65 year old woman with a history of PVD, HTN\nand CKD who presented with bilateral lower extremity weakness\nand numbness for six weeks.\n.\n1. T7 mass: The patient presented with lower extremity weakness\nand numbness. MRI of her T-spine showed a mass at the T7 level\nwith extension to the epidural space and cord edema concerning\nfor malignancy. A lumbar puncture was performed to evaluate for\nleptomeningeal involvement. CSF studies showed atypical\nplasmacytoid cells but it was not felt that the cells were\nmalignant in nature. A biopsy was taken of the T7 mass for\nfurther diagnosis. The biospy revealed poorly differentiated\ncarcinoma of unknown primary. The patient was seen by Neurology,\nNeuro-Oncology and Radiation Oncology. Ortho-Spine performed a\nT3 to T11 fusion without complication. A skeletal survey was\nperformed and did not demonstrate any evidence of lytic bone\ndisease. The patient began XRT on [**2101-1-28**]. She will receive a\ntotal of 10 days of XRT. She was started on dexamethasone which\nshould be tapered after completion of XRT. She will also follow\nup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] in Neuro-Oncology. DVT prophylaxis was\nprovided with lovenox and should be continued after discharge.\n.\n2. Third cranial nerve dysfunction: The patient was noted to\nhave right eye ptosis on admission. Neurology was consulted.\nLeptomeningeal disease was considered but not supported by the\nresults of lumbar puncture. The ptosis is most likely secondary\nto microvascular disease. Right eye ptosis improved with use of\nan eye patch that is alternated between eyes every 3 to 4 hours.\nThe patient was instructed to continue using the patch after\ndischarge.\n.\n3. Left upper extremity cephalic vein clot: The patient was\nnoted to have swelling and tenderness of the left upper\nextremity. Ultrasound demonstrated superficial clot. A heparin\ndrip was initiated then stopped because the clot was in a\nsuperficial vein.\n.\n4. Hypercalcemia: The patient was hypercalcemic on admission and\nwas found to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTHRP\nwas normal, but vitamin D was low. Because her calcium\nnormalized, no further work-up or intervention was pursued.\nVitamin D supplementation was initiated.\n.\n5. Microvascular disease on MRI: The patient likely had old\ndisease. It was treated with aspirin, clopidogrel and a statin.\n.\n6. Anemia: The patient experienced a significant drop in\nhematocrit post-operatively. She required 2 units of PRBCs after\nwhich her hematocrit responded appropriately and was stable for\nthe remainder of her stay.\n.\n7. UTI (enterococcus): The patient completed a 7-day course of\nvancomycin.\n.\n8. CAD/PVD: The patient had a history of RCA stenting. She had\nno signs of active ischemia during this admission. She was\ncontinued on a statin, beta-blocker, aspirin and clopidogrel.\n.\n9. HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension and was well\ncontrolled on this admission with amlodipine and a beta-blocker.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAmlodipine 5 mg once daily\nPlavix 75 mg daily\nLovastatin 10 mg daily\nPercocet prn\nAspirin 325 mg daily\nMetoprolol tartrate 100 mg twice a day\nLasix 20 mg prn daily\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
