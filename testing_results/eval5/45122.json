Right lower lobe\natelectasis is stable. There are low lung volumes.\nCardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.

No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2.\nMarked enlargement of left lower lobe mass and left hilar\nlymphadenopathy.\nThe left lower lobe mass obstructs adjacent bronchi, resulting\nin post-\nobstructive atelectasis and/or consolidation within the lower\nlobe and\ninferior segment of the lingula. 3. New small pericardial and\nsmall left pleural effusion. 4. No significant change in right\napical and superior segment right lower lobe pulmonary nodules,\nwith morphology concerning for possible synchronous neoplasms.\n5. Slight increase in left paratracheal and right hilar lymph\nnodes.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nA/P: 76 yo M with PMHx of stage IV NSCLC who presents with 3 wks\nof productive cough and now with hypoxia, tachycardia, and\nhypertension.\n.\n# PNEUMONIA: Clinical picture and chest xray most suggestive of\nLLL pneumonia, possibly post obstructive. Initially treated with\nvancomycin and levofloxacin; flagyl added for additional\nanaerobic coverage. Other considerations in the differential of\nshortness of breath include pulmonary embolism, ACS. CT chest\nshowed LLL pneumonia. He was evaluated by IP via bronchoscopy;\nthere was no stent placed. Radiation oncology saw the patient\nand set up a follow up appointment for additional consideration\nof radiation to the mass. He was discharged to complete a course\nof levofloxacin and metronidazole.\n.\n# COPD: emphysema per pulmonary notes but FEV1/FVC 105% of\npredicted and FEV1 85% of predicted in [**3-26**]. Given nebs during\nthe hospitalization.\n.\n# Renal Failure: baseline Cr 1.4-1.7. Stayed at baseline\nthroughout the admission.\n.\n# Hypertension: Continued lisinopril and HCTZ with holding\nparameters.\n.\n# Tachycardia: sinus tachycardia. Likely related to fever and\npneumonia. Resolved for now, will continue to monitor.\n.\n# Hypercholesterolemia: continued statin.\n.\n# Pain: had pleuritic chest pain on admission. CTA negative for\nPE; thought secondary to pleural proximity of pneumonia. Treated\nwith pain medications titrated to good effect.\n.\n# Lung Cancer: NSCLC, not currently on chemotherapy. Per onc\nnotes previous chemo regimen has been palliative chemo. He has\nstage IV NSCLC.
