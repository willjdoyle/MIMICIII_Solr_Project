Whipple procedure [**2102-9-13**]\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\n58-year-old gentleman was with an unusual appearing cystic mass\nin the head of his pancreas.  His story began 5 or 6 months ago\nwith an atypical attack of lower abdominal pain that was\nsuprapubic in nature.  This led to\nimaging at another hospital which revealed a cystic lesion in\nthe head of the pancreas that was not simple in its morphology.\nCurrently, he has a largish mass in the lower aspect of the head\nof the pancreas, an uncinate process which\nhas a thick wall septation and papillary projections.\nFurthermore, it is intimately adherent to the superior\nmesenteric vein.  All these features are worrisome for\namalignant degeneration of a cystic neoplastic process.  He had\nno associated n/v, weight loss, pruritus, jaundice or\nsteatorrhea.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1. Status post Whipple for pancreatic head mass\n2. Diabetes mellitus since [**2090**], insulin requiring\n3. Hypertension\n4. Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2093**], status post\nstent. Stress test [**8-31**] with small territory of partially\nreversible inferior defect consistent with ischemia on nuclear\nimaging with no associated angina or EKG changes.\n5. Circumcision [**2097**]\n\n\nSocial History:\n30 pack year h/o smoking.  no etoh or drug use currently but\nheavy etoh in the past.  currently in sales at department store.\n\nFamily History:\nHis family history is not significant for pancreatic cancer,\ncolorectal cancer, melanoma, pancreatitis, gallstones,\npolyposis,\nor other cancers. There is a family history of a brother and a\nsister who each have diabetes and increased blood pressure.\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\npreoperatively, afebrile with stable vital signs.  neck supple\nwithout lymphadenopathy.  heart regular rate and rhythm without\nmurmur.  lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  abdomen soft,\nnontender, no mass and no scars.  no axillary or groin\nlymphadenopathy.  extremities without edema.\n\nPertinent Results:\nI.  Gallbladder (A):\nNo diagnostic abnormalities recognized.\n\nII. Pylorus-sparing Whipple resection of the proximal pancreas\n(B-O):\n1.  Head of the pancreas:\nArea of chronic pancreatitis with mild activity and formation of\na cystic cavity containing necrotic debris and bacteria.\na)  Extensive fibrosis.\nb)  No neoplasm identified.\n\n2.  Pancreatic and common bile duct resection margins:\nNo diagnostic abnormalities recognized.\n\n3.  Duodenum:\nNo diagnostic abnormalities recognized.\n\n4.  Three lymph nodes:\nNo diagnostic abnormalities recognized.\n\n5.  Separate segment of small intestine:\no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.\n\nCT head [**2102-9-16**]:\nFindings consistent with brain edema. Please refer to the\nnuclear medicine brain scan which failed to demonstrate blood\nflow to the brain and is consistent with brain death.\n\nBrain Scan [**2102-9-16**]:\nThe study is consistent with brain death\n\nEEG [**2102-9-16**]:\nThis is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the\npresence of a very low-voltage, slow background rhythm that was\npresent\nthroughout the recording. This finding suggests the presence of\na\nsevere encephalopathy. Cortical activity, though abnormal, was\nseen at\nall times.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPresented to [**Hospital Ward Name **] as same day admit.  Underwent pylorus\npreserving whipple procedure [**9-13**].  Refer to operative report\nfor details. Did not require transfusions intraoperatively and\nblood loss estimated at 800cc. Remained intubated in recovery\nroom postoperatively overnight due to length of procedure.  Labs\ndrawn per whipple clinical pathway postoperatively and am of POD\n1 34.9 and 34.7 respectively.  Extubated morning of POD 1\nwithout difficulty.  Transferred to floor late afternoon of\npostoperative day 2.  Pain controlled via MSO4 PCA initially.\nSupplemented by two doses of Toradol.  Patient's heart rate\ndifficult to control with high doses of beta blockers\nintraoperatively.  Was placed on lopressor 10 mg IV q 4hrs\npostoperatively.  Heart rate remained 90's to 100's sinus\nrhythm.  Postop EKG unchanged from previous.  Postop CXR showed\nRIJ line in good position without evidence of pneumothorax.\nSmall right pleural effusion seen.  Patient was encouraged to\nuse an incentive spirometer post extubation POD 1.  Patient was\nkept NPO with NGT to medium continuous suction POD 1.  Patient\nhad made adequate urine POD 0 and 1.  Blood sugar difficult to\ncontrol POD 1 and [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes center consult requested.\n\nHis first postoperative day was uneventful. However, Mr. [**Known lastname 56151**]\nsuffered an aspiration event early on the morning of\npostoperative day two. Around 8am on [**9-15**], coded on the floor\nduring am rounds. Found by team to have agonal respirations.\nThere was question of aspiration event as NGT clotted with\nblood. A code event was called and we were able to revive him\ninitially from asystole. Code consisted of asystole and\npulseless electrical activity. Code was noted to be \"prolonged\",\n it was 3-5 minutes. However, had hypotension to 40s systolic\neven after restoration of pulse. Found to have large blood clots\nin trachea and from ETT s/p intubation, causing him to be\ninitially difficult to ventilate. Bilateral needle decompression\nand chest tube placement to rule out pneumothorax. After\nsuctioning of ETT clots, ventilation improved. Transferred to\nSICU.  Dropped hematocrit from 34.7 to 12.9. Was noted to cough,\ngag and move extremities spontaneously for several hours after\ncode. He intially overbreathed the vent. However, the patient\nbecame non- verbal and unresponsive overnight and the patient no\nlonger had a corneal reflex, gag, or cough, pupils fixed and\ndilated. No longer overbreathing vent.  After consultation of\nneurology and performing diagnostic studies, unfortunately, it\nbecame very clear that he suffered an anoxic brain injury. After\ndeclaration of brain death by our intensive care physicians, we\nmet with the family to discuss this. They elected to withdrawal\nsupport at that point and Mr. [**Known lastname 56151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2102-9-18**].\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. Micardis 20 mg po qd\n2.
