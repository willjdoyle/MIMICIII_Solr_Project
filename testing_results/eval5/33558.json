On HD 2, he had a  flexible\nbronchoscopy was  at\nthe bedside in the intensive care unit through an endotracheal\ntube. There was\nnear complete occlusion of the left main-stem bronchus with\nextrinsic compression was noted. The bronchoscope could not be\nadvanced past this obstruction. Purulent sputum was seen\nemanating from the left main-stem bronchus. On the right,\nsevere bronchomalacia was seen in the mainstem bronchus. A small\namount of purulent secretions seen in the right upper lobe,\nbronchus intermedius, right middle and lower lobe segmental\nbronchi, were all suctioned clean. Vancomycin and Zosyn were\nstarted empirically for pneumonia.  A BAL was sent.  later on HD\n2, she was taken to the OR for a rigid bronchoscopy.  Please see\noperative note for full details.  A biopsy of the occlusive\nairway lesion revealed a non small cell lung cancer.  Her LMSB\nwas balloon dilated to 12 mm.  A 14 x 40 mm covered metal stent\nwas placed.  A CT scan was done which showed central left upper\nlobe Mass contiguous with a mediastinal lymph node\nconglomeration, most consistent with advanced lung cancer. There\nis direct contact and mild compression on the aortic arch,\nencasement and obstruction of the left pulmonary artery, and\nencasement of the left main stem bronchus with partially\nobstructing mass distally. Dominant central cavity in left lung\nis likely related to necrotizing post- obstructive pneumonia,\nbut cavity component of neoplasm is also possible.  Multifocal\nbilateral pneumonia. Multiple left-sided cavities are consistent\nwith necrotizing pneumonia. Diffuse right peribronchial\nthickening may be due to either neoplastic infiltration or\ninfection.\nSmall bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion.\nCirrhosis and small amount of ascites.  On HD 2, she was\nextubated successfully.  A flexible bronchoscopy was done at the\nbedside- the stent was patent and secretions were aspirated.\nSaline nebs and Mucomyst nebs were started and Mucinex was\nstarted.  On HD 3, she continued to be stable.  A flexible\nbronch was again performed at the bedside for therapeutic\naspiration of secretions.  Overnight she had an episode of\nmania.  Psych was consulted (see note)recommended continue\nSeroquel and Haldol prn for agitation. She was seen by radiation\noncology who recommended starting XRT .  She received the first\nof ten 300 cGy treatment today.  She tolerated the treatment\nwell but was mildly paranoid. The patient was stable and to [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMeds at home:  Buspar 15'', Seroquel 300' + 100QHS, Synthroid\n0.113'\nMeds on transfer: Levaquin, Zosyn, Solumedrol 125, Midaz,\nPropofol, Lovenox\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
