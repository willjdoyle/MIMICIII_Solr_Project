He had a Merckel's brain tumor resected\n[**2149-8-14**] by [**Doctor Last Name **] which was complicated by small amounts of\nhemorrhage and recurrent Serratia meningitis (pansensitive)\ntreated with meropenem most recently. He had previosuly been\ntreated with a course of CTX. AMS x 1 day at rehab.  Per family\nrtepor, pt was first noted to have obvious slowing while eating\nhis dinner last night ([**2149-11-14**]). Wife noted that he was not\nholding his utensils properly and was at time speaking\nnonsensically.  Today, [**2149-11-15**], at PT, the therapist noted that\nhe was not follwoing commands and was more pt more \"slowed\"\nphysically. At baseline, pt is A&O x 1 (person only). He has a\npoor memory of past events, but does recall his wife and\ndaughter's names, although failed to remember them earlier\ntoday. Pt was also complaining of pain in the front of his head,\nwhich seemed to have resolved by the time he presented to the\nED. Of note, Dr. [**Known lastname 79613**] did have a HA in past with meningitis.\nHis wife notes that this is similar to his presentation with his\nprevious episodes of meningitis. On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**],\ninitial VS T 98.8, HR 118, BP 98/68, O2 96% on RA and pt able to\nfollow simple commands. Rectal temp 102, but patient did not\nrecieve Tylenol. Crani incision noted to be C/D/I. Guaiac\nnegative. CXR and UA unremarkable. Blood and urine Cx were\ndrawn. He recieved vanco, CTX 2g, ampicillin, dexamethasone,as\nwell as IVF. CT Head showed increasing edema in brain.  Labs are\nnotable for 83% PMNs on differential. Pt has not yet has an LP\ngiven brain edema. Pt was seen by both Neurology and\nNeurosurgery in the ED. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] from Neuro Onc was also\ncontact[**Name (NI) **]. Neurosurgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] both requested [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]\nadmission.

FNA was positive for malignant cells,\n\npositive for cytokeratin (AE1/3/CAM 5.2), CK20, synaptophysin,\nand chromogranin, negative for CD45, CK7, TTF-1, and S-100. The\n\nimmunophenotype suggested a neuroendocrine carcinoma. Imaging\nstudies showed FDG-avid enlarged left axillary lymph node\nwithout other concerning nodes or masses.\n- [**8-/2147**]/[**2146**]: 4 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide\n- [**11/2147**]/[**2147**]: received radiation\n- [**4-/2148**]: imaging study showed no evidence of recurrence of\n- [**8-/2149**]: several weeks of AMS --> large L\ntemporo/parietal/occipital lesion s/p craniotomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],\nbiopsy consistent with [**Location (un) 5668**] cell cancer\n#.

Progressive decreased density and size of the left\noccipitoparietal\nintracranial hemorrhage with surrounding edema. Within\nlimitations of motion degraded study, no definite areas of new\nhemorrhage.\n2. Again noted are hypodensities in bifrontal lobes, which\ncorrespond to\nsignal intensity changes on recent MRI of [**2149-10-20**], and\nmay represent underlying leptomeningeal disease as well as\nunderlying ischemic disease.\n3. Stable configuration of the ventricles with enlargement of\nthe left\ntemporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].\n.\n[**2149-11-15**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Stable chest x-ray examination with no\nacute process.\n.\n[**2149-11-17**] EEG: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to marked slowing\nand, at times, voltage reduction over the left posterior\ntemporal region with extension to the left occipital,\ncentro-parietal, and right occipital regions, on occasion. No\nassociated discharging features were seen. This would probably\nrepresent a structural or destructive process.\n.\n[**2149-11-17**] MRI: IMPRESSION:\n1. Rim-enhancing mass in the left parietal/occipital lobes with\ncentral\nrestricted diffusion, similar to prior. The restricted diffusion\nwithin this mass is similar to the postoperative and\npreoperative examinations, likely representing blood products\nand residual tumor. Superinfection of this cavity remains a\npossiblity, thought the unchanged adjacent FLAIR signal makes\nthis less likely.\n2. Interval expected evolution of the bifrontal\ninflammatory/destructive\nprocess compatible with the patient's known meningoencephalitis.\n\n.\n[**2149-11-19**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Satisfactory placement of PICC line.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n66yo M s/p recent resection of Merckel's neuroendocrine tumor\nwith 2 prior episodes of Serratia meningitis who presents from\nrehab with AMS x 1 day and fevers.\n.\n# AMS: DIfferential includes recurrent meningitis, other\ninfectious process, or post-ictal confusion. No evidence of new\nICH on CT head. In terms of potential infectious sources that\nhave been evaluated, CXR is unchanged with no obvious\ninfiltrate. UA is largely uninmpressive for an infection. Per\nd/c summary from last admission, the patient had a seizure while\non the medical floor that was responsive to Ativan, for which he\nhas since been on Keppra and EEG did not reveal any seizure\nfocus. Pt recieved empiric coverage for meningitis with Vanco,\nCTX 2g, and Ampicillin in the ED.  Neurology recommended MRI w\nand w/o contrast for further evaluation of evidence of\nmeningoencephalitis. Additonally, Neurosurgery recommends\nholding anti-coagulation. Pt was continued on home Keppra 500mg\n[**Hospital1 **].  Pt was initially on Dexamethasone 10mg IV q 6 hours.  In\nthe ICU, pt was started on Meropenem, per ID recs.  LP was\nperformed after the pt already received antibiotics.  The\ncultures are negtive to date, but cytology was positive for\nmalignant cells.\n.\n# C Diff colitis: Pt was cotninued on po vancomycin and per ID\nrecs, will need to continue until 10 days after the course of\nMeropenem is finished.\n.\n# s/p craniotomy, Merckel's tumor resection: Pt's Dexamethasone\nwas increased. It will be tapered over the next few days. Pt was\non Bactrim ppx, and its discontinuation will be determined by ID\nat the [**Hospital 702**] [**Hospital 3782**] clinic appt.\n.\nPt was on pneumoboots for DVT ppx.
