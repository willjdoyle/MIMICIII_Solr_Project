She presents\nwith change in mental status following whole brain radiation\ntherapy.  After discharge, the patient had whole brain\nradiation therapy at [**Hospital1 **] and received three out of ten\ntreatments starting on [**2121-10-10**] and since that time\nhas had increasing sedation, lethargy, sleeps all the time\nand was unable to go for her last whole brain radiation\ntherapy.  The patient did not take her medications at home\nbecause of being somnolent constantly.  She is currently\ncomplaining of nausea without emesis.\n\nAfter discussions with husband, she was noncompliant on her\nDecadron.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for incontinence of urine,\nwearing a diaper, pain well controlled on Fentanyl patch.\nDenied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or\ndyspnea on exertion.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Metastatic breast cancer, initially T2, N0, M0 with\nlymphatic invasion, multiple mets, see HPI.\n2.  Total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral\nsalpingo-oophorectomy in [**2118**].\n3.

Fentanyl patch 75 micrograms q. 72 hours.\n2.  Neurontin 600 mg b.i.d., 900 mg q.h.s.\n3.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.\n4.  Acetaminophen 650 mg q. four to six hours as needed for\npain.\n5.  Venlafaxine 150 mg q.d.\n6.  Dexamethasone 4 mg q.i.d.\n7.  Dilaudid 40 mg q. four to six hours as needed for pain.\n8.  Bactrim double-strength Monday, Wednesday, and Friday PCP\n[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with husband and has three\nchildren, 16 to nine-years-old.  Sister, [**Name (NI) **], intermittently\ninvolved along with her mother.  [**Name (NI) **] tobacco, alcohol\noccasional before recent hospitalizations.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile,\n80, 120/86, 18, 98% on room air.  General:  Alert and\noriented times three, lying in bed, limited because not\nfollowing commands, moist mucous membranes.  PERRLA.  No\npinpoint pupils.  Specific eye examination difficult because\npatient noncompliant, moving around.  Heart:  Regular rate\nwith normal S1, S2, no murmur.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation\nbilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, mildly tender, diffuse,\nnondistended, absent bowel sounds.  Neurologic:  Difficult to\nassess because not compliant.  Upgoing/upgoing toes.\n\nLABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 11.8,\nhematocrit 39.9, no left shift, platelets 348,000.  Sodium\n133.  The rest of the electrolytes were normal.  Anion gap of\n7.  LFTs unremarkable.  Calcium 9.3.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS:  Similar to\nthe previous admission.  The patient was restarted on the\nDecadron that she was noncompliant with.  The patient became\nmore somnolent overnight so an MRI was ordered the next day.\nThe patient did not show the marked improvement that she\ninitially did when started on Decadron the previous\nadmission.  The MRI showed increasing size of the right\nfrontal and right parietal metastases which are cystic in\nnature and that the brain was herniating.\n\nNeurosurgery was consulted.  The patient was started on\nMannitol and Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and transferred\nto the ICU for bedside bur hole drainage of these mets\nbecause she was becoming bradycardiac and hypertensive.  The\npatient was intubated and remained intubated for two days\nfollowing the procedure and then was extubated without\ndifficulty.  Each day subsequently, her mental status\nappeared to improve slightly to the point where she is alert\nbut not oriented to place.\n\nShe became more competent to discuss her medical care at that\npoint.  The Dilantin was changed to Keppra because she\ncontinued to receive whole brain radiation treatment during\nthese episodes and the goal is to complete a course, three\nfrom the outside hospital and seven while she is here in the\nhospital.  There has been association between Dilantin and\nwhole brain radiation leading to [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome so\nshe was switched to Keppra.\n\n2.  BREAST CANCER:  The patient, as she became more alert,\nexpressed her wishes that she would not like to proceed any\nfurther with chemotherapy treatment and that she felt that\nshe could not handle any more treatments.  The Palliative\nCare Team was consulted along with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and it was\nfelt best that if she finishes the whole brain radiation\ntreatment that she then goes to a rehabilitation center to\ntry to build up her strength.  She will not have any further\nchemotherapy.\n\n3.  HYPONATREMIA:  The patient was fluid restricted to 750 cc\nand her sodium remained 132.  It is most likely secondary to\nan SIADH component of her increased intracranial pressure.\n\n4.  PAIN:  Well controlled with the Fentanyl patch 75\nmicrograms and Dilaudid was used for breakthrough pain as\nneeded.\n\n5.  CODE STATUS:  The patient was initially full code.  After\nfurther discussions with her family and the patient, it was\nfelt that she would become DNR/DNI.  The Palliative Care Team\nwas extremely helpful in facilitating this process along with\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Deferred.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation center.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deferred.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:  Deferred.\n\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4286**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 15577**]\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 26705**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2121-10-26**]  10:56\nT:  [**2121-10-26**]  11:04\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 103567**]\n",
