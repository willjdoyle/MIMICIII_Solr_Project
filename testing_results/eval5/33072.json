Per\nPCP C/T-spine CT done, and C-spine CT shows C6 tumor. He reports\nthat approximately two weeks ago he developed R shoulder\nweakness, tingling, and pain that would radiate to his right\nhand. At the same time he developed R buttock pain, with\nintermittent R leg pain. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from\n[**Hospital **] hospital for further C-spine work-up and treatment. He\nwas initially admitted to the Neurosurgical service for the\nconcern of spinal cord compression. He had MRI c/t/l spine that\nshowed diffuse infiltration of the vertebral bodies w/o frank\ncord compromise. He was transfered to oncology for further\nmanagement.\n.\nCurrently he denies pain in his arm. He states that he is weak\nin the shoulder and elbow on the right side. He has no numbness\nor tingling of his right hand. The left shoulder is also weak\nbut not as much as the right. His legs feel strong to him.\n.\nROS: no chest pain. no shortness of breath. no cough. no\nnausea/vomiting/diarrhea. he feels constipated. no bowel or\nbladder incontinence. no jaundice. no fever/chills/sweats\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nHyperlipidemia\n\nSocial History:\nNon-smoker x 2 years (previously smoked 1.5 ppd x 20 years),\nrare EtOH intake, lives with wife of 14 years.

FTN limited by shoulder strength\n\nPertinent Results:\nLABS on admission:\n\nLABS on discharge:\n\nIMAGING:\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n62yo M w/ COPD admitted with right shoulder pain and weakness\nfound to have large lung mass, with lesions to brain (5 solitary\nlesions), spine (C5 and T11) and possibly the kidney, unknown\nprimary.\n\n1.Lung Mass and HYPOXIA: Lung mass presumed to be the primary\nlesion, given the multiple lesions in ipsilateral and\ncontralateral lung consistent with advanced disease. Previous\nbiopsies only obtained necrotic tissue, so unable to identify\nprimary malignancy prior to patients death.  Throughout the\ncourse of his admission he became progressively more hypoxic and\ntachycardic due to diffuse cancerous involvement of lungs\nbilaterally as well as associated emphysematous changes.  In\naddition, he likely developed a post obstructive pneumonia.  He\nwas intubated on [**12-25**] for hypoxic respiratory failure according\nto the patient and his wife's wishes.  He was treated with\nvancomycin and zosyn for post obstructive pneumonia.  Given the\nmassive involement of his lungs by tumor it was very unlikely\nthat he would ever come off of ventillatory support.  In\naddition given the late stage and wide spread metastasis of his\ncancer his prognosis was very poor.  This was discussed with the\npatient and his wife prior to intubation.  Following his\nintubation, the decision was made to make him comfort measures\nonly and withdraw ventillatory support on [**12-27**].  He died within\none hour of withdrawing ventillatory support.  He will have a\npost mortem autopsy according to the family's wishes.\n\n2. METASTATIC DISEASE: Pt has metastatic disease to brain,\ncontralateral lung, and spine (C5 and T11). Also possible that\nhe has disease in his kidney, given the abnormal 4.5 x 3.4cm L\nrenal mass seen on CT. Also has rising LFTs and RUQ tenderness,\nraising concern for liver mets. Most likely etiologies are\nmetastatic lung ca vs. metastatic RCC.  Neurologic status began\nto progress to involve bilateral arms so he was initially\nstarted XRT to C-spine, however this was stopped once his\ncondition progressed to respiratory failure.  He was continued\non dexamethasone for brain/spinal mets and seizure prophylaxis.\n\n\n3. LEUKOCYTOSIS: Most likely due to combination of steroids and\npost-obstructive pneumonia.  He was treated with vancomycin and\nzosyn.\n\n4. TRANSAMINITIS: Elevated LFTs and RUQ pain are concerning for\nliver metastases. INR 1.4 so may have synthetic dysfunction as\nwell (though pt's nutritional status is also poor which could be\ncontributing).  This was not evaluated further due to decline in\npatient quality of life and change of goals of care to comfort\nmeasures only.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nInsulin SC Sliding Scale\nLorazepam 0.5 mg IV Q8H:PRN anxiety\nAcetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN\nMorphine Sulfate 1-3 mg IV Q4H:PRN pain\nAtorvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY\nOndansetron 4 mg IV Q8H:PRN n/v\nBisacodyl 10 mg PO/PR DAILY\nOxycodone-Acetaminophen [**12-31**] TAB PO Q4H:PRN pain\nDexamethasone 4 mg PO Q6H\nPantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H\nDocusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID\nSenna 1 TAB PO BID\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\nexpired\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPatient expired\n\nDischarge Condition:\nexpired\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nexpired\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nexpired\n\n\n\n",
