She was treated broadly with\nampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl and was admitted to the\nFeniard Intensive Care Unit.\n\nThe patient's hypotension resolved overnight and was thought\nlargely secondary to volume depletion and possibly sepsis.\nAt that time, she was made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\nby her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] mental status was intermittent and\nconfused.  She was transferred to the floor where she\nimproved for a few days.\n\nOn [**4-12**], she developed agitation and further confusion;\nrequiring Haldol.  The patient was noted to develop stridor\nand tachycardia.  Multiple nebulizer treatment were tried\nwithout affect.  The patient was given Benadryl 25 mg p.o.\ntimes two and Cogentin 2 mg times two for suspected laryngeal\ndystonia from Haldol.  The patient was given Pepcid 20 mg\nintravenously times one and dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously\nfor a potential allergic reaction with no improvement.  The\npatient was unable to speak secondary to distress.\n\nEar/Nose/Throat was consulted and found no upper airway\nobstruction and normal cords.  The patient was admitted to\nthe Feniard Intensive Care Unit for a trial of [**Hospital1 **]-level\npositive airway pressure.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed in\n[**2173-4-16**] with three right upper lobe lesions; treated\nwith Taxol and carboplatin.  The patient was found to have\nnew lung nodules, liver metastases, and pelvis metastases in\n[**2174-5-16**].  She was given radiation therapy and then\nArissa.   Over the course of [**2174-9-16**] to [**2175-9-16**] the patient was found to have increasing liver function\ntests and noted to have worsening liver metastases.  In [**2175-1-14**], she was found to have brain metastases and underwent\nright frontal lobe resection with two smaller metastases\nremaining in [**2175-2-14**].  The patient was started on\nNavelbine salvage.\n2.  Reactive airway disease and emphysema.\n3.  Right thyroidectomy for colloid nodule.\n4.  Iron deficiency anemia.\n5.  Gastritis with Helicobacter pylori.\n6.  Depression.\n7.  History of abnormal PAP smear.\n8.  History of whole body image.\n9.  History of axillary abscess.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\n 1.  Atrovent meter-dosed inhalers.\n 2.  Haldol 0.5 mg p.o. twice per day as needed.\n 3.  Neutra-Phos two packets p.o. three times per day.\n 4.  Sucralfate 1 g four times per day.\n 5.  Dapsone 4 mg intravenously twice per day.\n 6.  Iron 325 mg p.o. once per day.\n 7.  Vitamin K 10 mg p.o. once per day.\n 8.  Docusate 100 mg p.o. twice per day.\n 9.  Lidoderm patch as needed.\n10.  Senna one tablet p.o. twice per day.\n11.  Lactulose 30 cc p.o. three times per day.\n\nCODE STATUS:  The patient is do not resuscitate/do not\nintubate.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 20-pack-year history of\nsmoking.  Occasional alcohol use.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:   Brain cancer, thyroid cancer, coronary\nartery disease, hypertension, and asthma.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination\nrevealed temperature was 98, blood pressure was 150/70,\nrespiratory rate was 28, heart rate was 125, and oxygen\nsaturation was 92% on 4 liters.  Generally, the patient was\nan ill-appearing female in moderate respiratory distress.\nHead, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed\nextraocular movements were intact.  Mucous membranes were\ndry.  Neck examination revealed no lymphadenopathy.  Audible\nstridor on expiration was heard.  Cardiovascular examination\nrevealed tachycardia.  Normal first heart sounds and second\nheart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The lungs were\nclear with the exception of decreased breath sounds up to\nhalfway up the right lung field and one quarter of the way up\nthe left lung field.  The abdomen was firm, distended, and\nnontender with normal active bowel sounds.  Extremity\nexamination revealed no edema.  On neurologic examination,\nthe patient was acutely agitated.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent\nlaboratory findings revealed the patient had a white blood\ncell count of 12.3, hematocrit was 33.1, and platelets were\n163.  INR was 2.  Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 144,\npotassium was 3.7, chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 19,\nblood urea nitrogen was 28, creatinine was 0.8, and blood\nglucose was 129.  Anion gap was 17.  The patient had a\nfibrinogen of 143.  D-dimer was greater than [**2171**].  FBE was\n80 to 160.  ALT was 213, AST was 737, alkaline phosphatase\nwas 497, and total bilirubin was 2.9.  Calcium was 7.8,\nphosphate was 2.3, and magnesium was 2.6.  Lactate was 12.5.\nFree calcium was 1.15.\n\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  On chest x-ray the patient had\na large right pleural effusion with a question of left lower\nlobe atelectasis.\n\nIMPRESSION:  The patient is a 48-year-old female with a\nhistory of poorly differentiated lung cancer with diffuse\nmetastases to the liver, pelvis, and brain; status post\ncarboplatin, Taxol, radiation therapy, Arissa, and metastases\nresection (on Navelbine salvage) who presented with\nhypotension, mild disseminated intravascular coagulation,\nacute renal failure, and lactic acidosis who now returned to\nthe Feniard Intensive Care Unit with acute respiratory\ndistress.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\n\n1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient with a question of acute\nstridor with an unchanged chest x-ray.\n\nThe differential diagnosis initially included a dystonic\nreaction from Haldol or an allergic reaction.  However, the\npatient did not respond to Cogentin, Benadryl, steroids, or\nH2 blockers; and Ear/Nose/Throat ruled out any upper airway\nswelling or laryngeal spasms.\n\nThus, it was thought that the patient had a fixed\nobstruction; perhaps some lymph nodes or lung cancer which\nbecame clinically evident as wheezing or stridor in the\nsetting of increased mini-ventilation from progressive\nmetabolic acidosis.  Heliox was attempted without success,\nand the patient was started on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway\npressure with no real improvement in her symptoms.  She was\nnot any more responsive on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure\nand required morphine for some sedation to enable her to work\nwith the [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure.  Her respiratory\nstatus did not improve clinically.\n\n2.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient with mental status\nchanges in the setting of diffusely metastatic breast cancer\nwith liver involvement and hepatic encephalopathy as well as\nhypoxia and worsening acidosis with hypercarbia.  Her mental\nstatus did not improve despite the aggressive measures in the\nIntensive Care Unit.\n\n3.  GASTROENTEROLOGY ISSUES:  The patient with rapidly\nprogressive liver failure; likely secondary to metastatic\nnon-small-cell lung cancer with diffuse involvement.\nProgressive metabolic lactic acidosis was likely secondary to\nhepatic failure.\n\n4.  HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY ISSUES:  The patient with metastatic\nlung cancer diffusely spread to liver, [**Hospital1 500**], and brain.\nNearing the end-stage on salvage Navelbine.  The patient had\nongoing evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\nThe overall prognosis, according to the patient's primary\noncologist, was uniformly poor.\n\n5.  CODE ISSUES:  The patient presented with progressive lung\ncancer diffusely metastatic which was refractory to multiple\nchemotherapeutic regimens, brain metastases resection, and\nradiation therapy.  She developed worsening respiratory\nfailure in the setting of progressive lactic acidosis,\npleural effusions, respiratory acidosis, and altered mental\nstatus.\n\nAfter discussing the patient's uniformly poor prognosis with\nher oncologist, as well as her husband (who was her health\ncare proxy), the decision was made to make the patient\ncomfort measures only.  The patient expired with family at\nthe bedside.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Expired.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient expired.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Respiratory failure.\n2.  Poorly differentiated metastatic non-small-cell lung\ncancer.\n3.  Progressive metabolic lactic acidosis.\n4.  Right pleural effusion.\n5.  Liver failure.\n6.  Acute renal failure.\n7.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n8.  Supraventricular tachycardia.\n9.  Reactive airway disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] N. 12-981\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5246**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2175-4-13**]  11:58\nT:  [**2175-4-15**]  05:05\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 100596**]\n\ncc:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 100597**]",
