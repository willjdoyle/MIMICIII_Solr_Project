Patient recieved radiation yesterday (Day 2) after which\nhe went home. He has been having a constant, bilaterally frontal\nthrobbing headache for about 1 week which has been worsening for\nthe last three days. His headache is worsened by movement and\nwalking and ameliorated by staying still and laying down.\nIbuprofen and hydromorphone also improve his headache but do not\ncompletely make it dissapear. He describes his pain as [**9-13**] on\nthe pain scale. When the patient arrived home from XRT he\nstarted to get confused and does not remember a couple of hours\nwhile he was in his bedroom. He says his memory started to come\nback when as he was walking to the bathroom he fainted and lost\nconsciousness. The patient denies any trauma from his fall. His\nroomate wittnessed this event and was unavailable for\nquestioning, however the patient told me that his freind said he\nsimply looked like he was sleeping and did not describe anything\nlike shaking, or eyes rolling to the back of his head. The\npatient woke up in his bed and denies any tongue biting,\nnumbness or paralysis of limbs, or funny smells. He also felt\nnauseated during the whole day yesterday, without vomiting,\nwhich has improved overnight without any meds and currently the\npatient has an appetite. The patient has received radiation in\nthe past for lung cancer and Day 1 currently of his radiation\nregimen, however he never experienced such severe headache,\nsyncope or amnesia before. He has completed two of 15 planned\nfractions of radiation therapy to the whole Brain for metastatic\ncancer.  He was told by his [**Name8 (MD) 50859**] NP to proceed to the\nE.R.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nPast Oncologic History:\nCurrent Therapy:\n-He has completed two of 15 planned fractions of radiation\ntherapy  currently to the whole brain for metastatic brain\ncancer.\n.\nPrevious Chemotherapy:\n-Completed courses of cisplatin and etoposide concurrently with\nradiation therapy on [**2195-12-14**] and ending [**2195-12-28**]; of note,\njust prior to starting therapy, he was found to have a large\nleft pleural effusion with cytology positive for metastatic\nadenocarcinoma, indicating the presence of Stage IV disease.\n-Alimta for three cycles finishing on [**2196-3-2**]; with disease\nprogression noted on Sunitinib on [**2196-4-13**], this was stopped on\n[**2196-7-14**].\n-His disease has remained radiographically stable since that\ntime, with his most recent CT scan obtained on [**2196-6-29**].\n-At the time of his last visit in the medical oncology clinic on\n[**2196-7-6**], he admitted to recurrent headaches.  An MRI revealed\ninnumerable enhancing lesions within the supra- and infra\ntentorium of the brain as well as at least one lesion within the\nleft frontal calvarium and an additional lesion within the upper\nspinal cord.  Many punctate lesions appeared to be present\nwithin the cortical sulci.  In addition, he had enhancement\nalong the sulci, brainstem internal auditory canals, and\ntrigeminal nerve  - consistent with leptomeningeal metastases.\n.\nPrevious Radiation:\n-Competed on [**2195-12-28**] 21 fractions of treatment to the left\nupper lung; hilum and mediastinum at dose of 6120 cGy\n.\nOther Past Medical History:\n1.  HIV infection - FAMILY UNAWARE OF DIAGNOSIS - diagnosed\nseveral years ago, most recent CD4 count 143,000. The patient\nstarted antiretroviral medications in 08/[**2195**].\n2.  History of syphilis, treated.  He has had no other\nopportunistic infections.\n3.  Hemorrhoids, status post surgical resection in [**2189**].\n4.  History of peptic ulcer disease.\n\n\nSocial History:\nPatient lives in [**Location 577**], lives with roomate.  Works as a\nwaiter.  Has smoked marijuana daily for the last 3-4 years.\nSmoked [**2-6**] cigarettes/week; has 15 pack year history but stopped\n4-5 years ago.  Reports 1 beer per week. Tried cocaine and\ncrystal meth in the past.  Has sex only with men and reportedly\nuses protection for all sexual practices.\n\n\nFamily History:\nDenies any history of CAD, cancer, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVS: 119/79 105 25 98% ra\nGEN: AOx3, NAD\nHEENT:  PERRLA.

Left upper\nlobe/suprahilar\nspiculated opacity likely represents patient's known mass,\nlymphadenopathy and\nfluid, better evaluated on CT.\n.\n[**7-28**] CT-Head with contrast: IMPRESSION: No CT evidence of acute\nintracranial abnormality. Please note that MRI is more sensitive\nin assessing brain lesions.\n.\n[**7-28**] MRI-Head with contrast: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable appearance of\ninnumerable enhancing lesions within the supra and\ninfratentorial brain as well as at least one lesion within the\nleft frontal calvarium consistent with metastatic disease. 2.\nStable enhancement along the sulci, brainstem, internal auditory\ncanals, and trigeminal nerves, consistent with leptomeningeal\nspread of disease. 3. No acute infarction or hemorrhage.\n.\n[**7-29**] EEG: MPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the\nwaking and sleeping\nstates due to two regions of focal slowing seen in the right\nposterior\nquadrant and left posterior temporal regions independently.\nThese\nabnormalities are suggestive of subcortical lesions in these\nareas.\nThere were no epileptiform abnormalities noted.\n.\n[**8-2**] Cytology: Cerebrospinal fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS\nconsistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.\n.\n[**8-5**] CT-Head without Contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial\npathology.\n.\n[**8-10**] CT-Stroke: CONCLUSION: 1. Stable right frontal hypodensity,\nmost suggestive of metastasis with vasogenic edema. No acute\nintracranial hemorrhage. 2. Widely patent head and neck\narteries. 3. Incompletely evaluated pleural and parenchymal\ndisease in the left upper\nlobe most likely representing sequelae of the known lung cancer.\n .\n[**8-11**] EEG: MPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the persistent left\nfrontal focal delta slowing. This suggests a focal structural\nabnormality in the left anterior quadrant. Anatomic correlation\nwould be of interest if clinically indicated. The background\nrhythm was otherwise well maintained posteriorly, and there were\nno epileptiform features.\n.\n[**8-11**] CT-Head: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2.\nStable right frontal hypodensity, compatible with edema from\nknown metastatic disease at this site.\n.\n[**8-13**] CT-Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process, and no\nchange from [**2196-8-11**].\nStable right frontal hypodensity, reflecting vasogenic edema\nfrom known\nmetastatic lesion at this site.\n.\n[**8-15**] CXR: There is interval increase in left pleural effusion\nwhich is currently large\nand is most likely combined with a known advanced lung cancer\nwithin the left\nlung. Only minimal apical portion of the left lung continues to\nbe aerated.\nThe right lung is essentially clear with no evidence of right\npleural\neffusion.\n.\n[**8-15**] CT-Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Right\nfrontal hypodensity,\npossible metastatic, stable since [**8-5**]. MRI is more sensitive\nfor\nevaluating for metastatic disease.\n.\n[**8-16**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-15**], the\nendotracheal and\nnasogastric tubes have been removed. Extensive opacification\ninvolving the\nleft hemithorax is essentially unchanged, consistent with the\nknown advanced\nlung cancer and associated effusion and atelectasis. There is\nonly a small\namount of the apical portion of the left lung continues to be\naerated. The right lung remains essentially clear.\n.\n[**8-17**] CXR: Increased rightward mass effect on mediastinal\nstructures compared to two days prior suggests interval increase\nin left pleural effusion.\n.\nEKG:\n[**7-28**]: Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of\n[**2196-4-8**] the rate is\nslower.\n[**8-12**]: Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of\n[**2196-7-28**] there is no\nsignificant diagnostic change.\n[**8-31**]: Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of\n[**2196-8-12**] the rate has\nincreased. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nSummary & Formulation on Presentation, [**2196-7-28**]:\n40 yoM with HIV, metastatic lung CA with brain metastases, s/p\nfirst whole brain radiation treatment, now with nausea,\nvomiting, headache, confusion, amnesia, and a syncopal episode\nprior to admission.\n.\nHospital Course By Problem on Discharge [**2196-9-4**]:\n.\n# Headache/nausea/vomiting/confusion/amnesia/syncope - After an\nextensive work-up including multiple CT-scans of the head with\nand without contrast, MRI of the head with contrast, EEG x 3,\nand LP x 2 - both of which revealed elevated ICP and were\npalliative for the patient's headache, and the first of which\ngrew out negative cultures and demonstrated malignant cells -\nneurology diagnosed the patient's constellation of symptoms to\nbe caused by progressive metastatic leptomeningeal lung\nmetastases in the setting of whole-brain XRT-associated cerebral\nedema; seizure and stroke were ruled out. During the\nhospitalization, the patient was started and continued on\nanti-seizure medication, titrating Keppra up to 1250mg twice\ndaily. Dexamethasone was also started and continued to treat\ncerebral edema in the setting of ongoing whole brain radiation.\nThe patient is being discharged on these medications to a rehab\nfacility with hospice.\n.\n# Progressive decline in cognitive function - Over the course of\nthe hospitalization, the patient suffered a stroke-like episode\nthought to be caused by leptomeningeal disease. This episode\nprecipitated a number of tests described above, which ultimately\npointed to the diagnosis of progressive leptomeningeal\nmetastatic lung cancer. Following this episode, after which the\npatient recovered some function, the patient's cognitive\nfunction precipitously and progressively declined, presumably\ndue to the natural history of leptomeningeal metastatic lung\ncancer and due to superimposed cerebral edema caused by what was\nat the time ongoing daily whole brain radiation as well as\nsuperimposed hyponatremia secondary to SIADH, itself caused\npotentially by pain or some other unclear etiology. The\npatient's mental status waxed and waned after the initial\nstroke-like episode, but overall, his mental status has steadily\ndeclined - he is now inconsistently oriented to person, place,\nand time, unable to concentrate, and intermittently visually\nhallucinating; he has also developed intermittent, sporadic\nballistic movements and change in voice. Of note, he still\nrecognizes his loved ones, including his mother, who obtained an\nemergency Visa from [**Country 4194**] through the assistance of the [**Hospital1 18**]\nsocial work department in conjunction with Senator [**Doctor First Name 69434**]\noffice in order to visit her son in his now imminently declining\nstate.\n.\n# Leptomeningeal metastatic lung cancer: The patient received 13\nout of 15 daily scheduled whole brain radiation treatments in\nconjunction with daily dexamethasone for cerebral edema. He\ntolerated the treatments reasonably well.\n.\n# Transient unresponsiveness - On [**2196-8-14**] the patient was found\nunresponsive on the floor and was intubated for airway\nprotection and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  His respiratory status\nimproved, and he was extubated on [**2196-8-15**]. In the ICU, the\npatient received neuro checks q2hrs and his anti-sz medications,\nincluding Keppra and steroids, were given by iv. He developed\nhyponatremia while in the ICU, which was likely secondary to his\nmalignancy.  He was administered hypertonic saline and PO salt\ntabs.  His sodium gradually improved from 124 to 130.  The\npatient was maintained on  his HAART regimen in the ICU, and\nboth the oncology and neurology services continued to follow the\npatient. For DVT prophylaxis the patient was maintained on\npneumoboots and famotidine for GI ppx.\n.\n# Non-traumatic falls - On several occasions during the\nhospitalization, the patient was found on the floor by his bed;\nnone of these episodes resulted in any trauma. Safety [**Last Name (un) **] and\na Sitter were implemented to reduce the risk of falls.\nRestraints were also used, but eventually removed due to a\nslight improvement in mental status.\n.\n# Hyponatremia - Analysis of serum and urine osmolality in the\nsetting of euovolemia pointed to a diagnosis of SIADH. The\npatient's hyponatremia was managed conservatively in\ncollaboration with the consulting Nephrology team with fluid\nrestriction titrated to 2L daily and salt tabs titrated to 2 gm\nPO every 6h.\n.\n# Pleural Effusion - Presumed to be a malignant pleural\neffusion, since it has been a recurring chronic problem.\nDiagnostic tap was not pursued. The patient required no\nsupplemental oxygen.\n.\n# HIV/AIDS- We Continued home HIV meds and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]; CD4\ncount on admission was 84 and 46 on discharge. Patient had\nthrush detected on [**8-2**] and was treated by nystatin swish and\nswallow. Of note, THE FAMILY AND POTENTIALLY HIS PARTNER ARE\nUNAWARE OF HIS HIV STATUS.\n.\n# Bacteremia - The patient had gram positive cocci in pairs and\nclusters growing in his blood early in the hospitalization; it\nmost likely was a contaminant because of only one positive\nculture and no signs of clinical infection, Vancomycin was\nstarted and discontinued on [**8-2**].\n.\n# C.Dif - The patient developed loose stool over the course of\nthe hospitalization, was placed on contact precautions and\nstarted empirically on oral flagyl, which was subsequently\ndiscontinued after cultures were negative for C.Dif.\n.\n# MRSA - Found to be MRSA negative.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nOmeprazole 20mg daily p.o\nHydromorphone 2mg Q6H PRN p.o\nOndansetron 8mg Q8H PRN p.o\nLorazepam 0.5mg --->prior to LP\nDexamethasone -4mg [**Hospital1 **] p.o\nBactrim - daily\nAtripla- Emtricitabine 200mg , Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-300\nmg , Efavirenz- 600mg\nCyclobenzaprine  10 mg Tablet\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

We carried out imaging tests to\nassess your brain tumors and you were seen by the neurology\nphysicians, who believed that your chronic symptoms as well as\nyour acute episode of right sided weakness early in your\nhospitalization course may have been caused by seizures or\nstroke. You were started on medications to prevent seizure and\nreduce the brain swelling normally caused by whole brain\nradiation. Your symptoms improved on these medications as well\nas analgesics and they improved further after the neurology\nphysicians drained fluid from around your brain on two\noccasions. After evaluating you extensively, reviewing the brain\nimage, and observing your brain's electrical activity, the\nneurology physicians determined that your symptoms were not\ncaused by seizures or stroke and that they were most likely\ncaused by the progressing metastatic lung tumors in your brain.\nWe continued the radiation to your brain at the hospital to\ntreat the tumors and you tolerated these procedures well; we\nalso continued your anti-seizure and anti-swelling medications\nand started you on a salt tablet and fluid restrictions to\nmaintain normal electrolyte levels, which are important to brain\nfunction. Unfortunately, due to the progressive nature of your\ndisease, despite these interventions, your mental status\nprecipitously and permanently declined from your baseline prior\nto being admitted to the hospital. As we have already discussed\nwith your family, we are unable to provide further treatments\nthat may reverse the progression of your brain metastases and we\nanticipate that your mental functioning will continue to\ndecline.\n.\nWe are discharging you from the hospital on the following\nmedications:\n.\n# LeVETiracetam Oral Solution 1250 mg twice daily for seizure\n# Lorazepam 0.5 mg IV every 4h as needed for seizure\n# Dexamethasone 4 mg IV every 6h\n# Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) 1 TAB daily\n# Efavirenz 600 mg daily\n# Sulfameth/Trimethoprim DS 1 TAB daily\n# Sodium Chloride 2 gm PO every 6h for hyponatremia\n# Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose one drop in each eye daily for\ndry eyes\n# Acetaminophen [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1999**] mg every 6h as needed for pain\n# Bisacodyl 10 mg by mouth or per rectum daily as needed for\nconstipation\n# Lactulose 30 mL every 8h as needed for constipation\n# Docusate Sodium 100 mg twice daily for constipation\n# Senna 1 TAB twice daily for constipation\n# Ondansetron 8 mg IV every 8h as needed for nausea\n# Prochlorperazine 10 mg IV every 6h as needed for nausea\n# Lansoprazole Oral Disintegrating Tab 30 mg daily\n# Nystatin Oral Suspension 5 mL swish and swallow daily as\nneeded for thrush\n# Sodium Chloride 0.9% Flush 3 mL IV Q8H:PRN line flush\n.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nNone\n\n\n\n",
