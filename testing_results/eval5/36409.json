Her melanoma\nhistory starts with some ulcerating lesions in the posterior\nshoulder about [**Doctor Last Name **] years ago.  She was eventually seen when it\nhas got such a big size and there was\nulceration and exudation when an MRI showed a 9.7 x 7.1 x 7.9 cm\nmass in that shoulder, which was lobulated.  A CT scan on [**3-29**], [**2119**], showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.  She\nunderwent surgical resection of this lesion, which confirmed\nmelanoma.  She was seen in the [**Hospital1 188**] for consideration of high-dose IL-2.  She had a staging\nbrain MRI in [**2120-4-19**], which showed no metastatic lesion.  She\nhad a short course of high-dose IL-2, which was completed in\n[**2120-6-19**].\nHer neurological and neuro-oncological history starts when she\nwas noticed to have a 3-week history of some dizziness and\ndecreased coordination in her left hand.  She went to the [**State 1727**]\nemergency room and had a head CT, which showed a posterior fossa\nmass.  She was sent to the [**Hospital1 69**]\nand an MRI was done.  This showed a central 1.7 cm mass deep in\nthe left cerebellum along with dentate nucleus, which\ncontributed to her symptoms.  She was commenced on Decadron,\nwhich improved her symptoms and she was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\nin the Neurosurgery for consideration for radical resection.\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] thought this is a deep seated and resection of which\nmight moisten her coordination and left upper limb symptoms and\nthe patient was not keen to have surgery.  Hence, she was asked\nto be seen by me for consideration of stereotactic radiosurgery.\nMs. [**Known lastname 82490**] symptoms of left-sided hand upper limb incoordination\nhave improved somewhat with Decadron.  She does not have any\nother higher function, cranial nerve, sensory, motor, or\nneurological dysfunction.\n\nPast Medical History:\nas noted in HPI\n\nSocial History:\nShe is married.  She is seen with her husband. She lives in\n[**State 1727**].  She has two grown sons and she is active in her farm\nwith animals and gardening.  She quit smoking in [**2104**], but she\nsmoked for about 14 years.  She does not abuse alcohol.\n\n\nFamily History:\nHer father has had some nonmelanoma skin cancers.  Her one\npaternal uncle who died of metastatic melanoma. She has two\nsisters who have nonmelanoma skin cancers as well. No other\nhistory of cancers in the family.\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nOn Discharge:\nShe is alert, oriented to person, place and date. PERRL, she has\nno pronator drift, or alternate cerebellar findings. Full\nstrength and power throughout all extremities\n\nPertinent Results:\nLabs on Imaging:\n[**2120-8-21**] 08:00PM BLOOD WBC-7.0 RBC-5.14 Hgb-14.6 Hct-44.7 MCV-87\nMCH-28.4 MCHC-32.6 RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-363\n[**2120-8-21**] 08:00PM BLOOD Neuts-83.0* Lymphs-15.1* Monos-1.0*\nEos-0.2 Baso-0.5\n[**2120-8-21**] 08:00PM BLOOD PT-11.9 PTT-22.3 INR(PT)-1.0\n[**2120-8-21**] 08:00PM BLOOD Glucose-222* UreaN-13 Creat-0.8 Na-139\nK-4.5 Cl-100 HCO3-26 AnGap-18\n[**2120-8-21**] 08:00PM BLOOD ALT-31 AST-23 AlkPhos-84 TotBili-0.6\n[**2120-8-21**] 08:00PM BLOOD Calcium-11.3* Phos-4.5 Mg-2.2\n\nLabs on Discharge:\n[**2120-8-24**] 06:55AM BLOOD WBC-10.0 RBC-4.87 Hgb-14.1 Hct-42.9\nMCV-88 MCH-28.9 MCHC-32.8 RDW-13.4 Plt Ct-391\n[**2120-8-24**] 06:55AM BLOOD Plt Ct-391\n[**2120-8-24**] 06:55AM BLOOD Glucose-177* UreaN-25* Creat-0.8 Na-141\nK-4.2 Cl-101 HCO3-28 AnGap-16\n[**2120-8-24**] 06:55AM BLOOD Calcium-10.4* Phos-3.9 Mg-2.4\n\n-------------\nIMAGING:\n-------------\nHead CT [**8-21**]:\nFINDINGS: Non-contrast head CT is performed. As on the outside\nhospital\nstudy, there is a left cerebellar lesion measuring 1.5 x 1.4 cm\nwith\nsurrounding vasogenic edema causing slight mass effect on the\nfourth\nventricle. There is no evidence of hemorrhage or obstructive\nhydrocephalus. No additional lesions are seen.\nIMPRESSION: Left cerebellar lesion with surrounding vasogenic\nedema,\nconcerning for metastasis. Correlation with MRI is advised.\n\nMRI Head [**8-22**]:\nFINDINGS: As seen on the preceding CT scan, there is a mass\ncentered within the anterior medial aspect of the left\ncerebellar hemisphere, demonstrating predominant T2\nhyperintensity and T1 hypointensity. There is extensive adjacent\nedema involving the dentate nucleus and more superior cerebellar\nhemisphere, as well as extending into the brachium pontis. The\nmass does bulge into, though is not situated within the fourth\nventricle. There is heterogeneous enhancement. No associated\nleptomeningeal enhancement is identified and no additional\nlesions are seen. Restricted diffusion is present along the\nlateral margin of the mass. Overall dimensions are 1.4 x 1.5 x\n1.8 cm. There are otherwise scattered T2 hyperintensities within\nthe subcortical and deep white matter in a pattern suggestive of\nsmall vessel disease. Ventricles are normal, despite mass effect\nupon the fourth ventricle as detailed. The flow voids are\nnormal.\nIMPRESSION: Solitary heterogeneously enhancing mass within the\nleft\ncerebellar hemisphere with mild mass effect. Primary\ndifferential\nconsiderations would include metastatic disease or lymphoma,\nprimary tumors such as hemangioblastoma and abscess. The\nrestricted diffusion without significant susceptibility artifact\nsuggests a highly cellular tumor as seen in lymphoma. WE favor\nmetastasis or lymphoma.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient was admitted for newly diagnosed posterior fossa lesion.\nShe was seen and evaluated by Neuro and Radiation oncology who\ndetermined cyberknife to be the best treatment at this point in\ntime. She received her cyberknife treatment on [**8-23**], and was\ndetermined to be appropriate for disposition to home on [**8-24**].
