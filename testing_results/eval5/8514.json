On arrival to the ED, patient reported worsening\ndyspnea and pleuritic chest pain for several days prior to\npresenting to the outside hospital, as well as pleuritic left\nsided chest pain.  Subsequently, the patient was intubated for\nrespiratory distress.  History was limited given the patient was\nintubated at the time of evaluation, but she denies chills,\nheadache, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, or abdominal\npain.  She reports progressive dyspnea, worse with exertion,\nfever to 101, and cough productive of yellow sputum.  She\nreports back and neck pain, which is chronic.  She reports\ncompliance with all of her medications, including her HAART and\nbactrim/azithro.  Patient was slightly hypotensive after\nintubation and improved when sedation was weaned.\n.\nDuring her last admission for pneumonia in [**2192-6-29**], she was\ninitially treated with Ceftriaxone and Flagyl, and later\ntransitioned to Augmentin at the time of discharge.  She\nunderwent thoracentesis, which revealed an exudative effusion\nwith cells consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Pleural\nfluid was culture negative.  There was no lung re-expansion so\npleurex catheter was placed.  She also underwent bronchoscopy\nwhich revealed complete right main bronchus obstruction, so\nright bronchial stenting was performed.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1. Both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the lung and RUL\nlobectomy, with metastatic NSCLC with brain mets, status post\nstereotactic radiosurgery to a right cerebellar resection cavity\nand a right occipital metastasis, followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]; history\nof SVC syndrome; she is being treated with Tarceva for\npalliative control of tumor burden\n2. HIV diagnosed in [**2173**], contracted status post blood\ntransfusion from birth of son, c/b PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and thrush. Also\nwith history of Lymphoma after having axillary LAD. Last CD4 was\n67 on [**2192-5-21**]. Switched to new regimen ~1.5 months ago.\n3. Total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine cancer in [**2184**]\n4. Carotid artery aneurysm on L\n5. Emphysema\n6. status post Cholecystectomy\n\n\nSocial History:\nPrior 30 pack-year smoking history per records.  She drinks\nalcohol occasionally. She used marijuana many years ago but\ndenies any recent illicit drug use. She lives with her husband\nand her son.\n\n\nFamily History:\nHer father is alive with CAD, mother is alive with CAD and\nhistory of CVA. One of her sisters had ovarian cyst, and one of\nher brothers died as an infant from an unknown cause.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nT = 98.6; HR = 107; BP = 114/66; RR = 24; O2 = 100% (AC:\n300/24/5/0.8)\nGEN:  intubated, appears uncomfortable, alert, NAD\nHEENT:  PERRL bilat, EOMI bilat, anicteric, MMM\nNeck:  supple, no LAD, no JVD, + visible pulsating left carotid\n(known aneurysm)\nCV:  RRR, no m/r/g\nResp:  decreased breath sounds on right, Left CTA without\ncrackles, or wheezes anteriorly\nAbd:  NABS, soft, non-distened, non-tender, no masses\nBack/skin:  + stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer\nExt: warm, dry; [**2-2**]+ pitting edema bilaterally\nNeuro:  A&Ox3, CN II-XII intact, strength intact grossly\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nOn Admission:\n\n11.3>24.7<519\nN:91.1 L:4.8 M:3.9 E:0.2 B:0\n\n[**Age over 90 **]|98|15 /88\n3.9|35|0.3\\\nCa:8.8 Mg:1.9 P:3.3\n\nALT:8 AST:16 LDH:180 AP:128 [**Doctor First Name **]:23 Lip:12 Tbili:0.3 Alb:2.5\nHaptoglobin:424\n\nABG:7.33/54/111\nLactate:2.9\n\nCK:16 CK-MB:Not done Trop-T < 0.01\n\nUA: Clear, SG:1.011 pH:5.0, small nitrate, rest of dipstick\nnegative, RBC:0-2 WBC:[**6-8**] Bact:occ Yeast:none Epi:0-2 WBC\ncasts:0-2\n\nBAL: WBC:0 RBC:0 P:80 L:0 M:0 Macro:20\n\nCXR: Comparison is made to [**2192-7-20**].  There is persistent\ncomplete opacification of the right hemithorax.  There is a\npersistent right lateral indentation on the trachea.  There is\nworsening opacity in the left lung with multiple nodules, which\nappear slightly larger, although this could be due to adjacent\nopacity.  Surgical clips are again noted in the right upper\nquadrant.  Left chest tube remains in place. Appearance of the\nright main stem bronchus stent is unchanged.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n36 year-old woman with history of HIV/AIDS (CD4=56) on HAART and\nPCP/MAC prophylaxis), metastatic squamous and adenocarcinoma of\nthe lung (on tarceva) with brain mets and chronic malignant\neffusion status post right bronchial stenting [**7-3**], recently\ndischarged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission for pneumonia who\npresents from outside hospital for acute onset shortness of\nbreath.  She was intubated in ED for respiratory distress.\n.\n1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The etiology of her acute respiratory\ndistress was unclear on admission, but is likely related to a\nworsening left sided pneumonia.  Other possibilities for acute\ndecompensation include pulmonary embolism since she is likely\nhypercoagulable or and increase in her tumor burden.  A chest\nCTA was not performed due to her iodine allergy.  Upper and\nlower extremity ultrasounds were significant for non-occlusive\nclots in axillary and subclavian veins bilaterally.  Therefore,\nthe possibility of a pulmonary embolism could not be excluded;\nhowever, she was not started on heparin empirically due to the\npresence of brain metastasis.  She was started on empiric\nantibiotics (vancomycin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone,\nmetronidazole, and Bactrim) for community acquired pneumonia,\natypical pneumonia, and PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] bronchoscopy showed a patent\nproximal stent in the right mainstem bronchus with tumor\novergrowth as well as diffuse mucosal edema on the left with\nthin watery discharged.  The bronchial lavage was negative for\nPCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Bactrim was stopped.  On hospital day 2, she began to\nhave continued increased oxygen requirement and a chest x-ray\nshowed increased left lower lobe opacity.  Upon talking to the\nhusband and family, it was decided to see if her respiratory\nstatus improved with the antibiotics.  Her respiratory status\ncontinued to decline as she became more hypoxic and more\nhypercarbic requiring increased ventilator adjustments.  On\nhospital day 4, the husband and family decided to withdraw\nventilator support and the patient expired.\n\n2) HYPOTENSION: She had transient hypotension after intubation\nthat was likely secondary to sedation.  However, her clinical\npicture was concerning for sepsis given her respiratory failure,\nreported fever, and tachycardia.  Her lactate was mildly\nelevated, but that may be from her HAART medications.  Her mean\narterial blood pressure was maintained above 60 with fluid\nboluses.\n\n3) HIV/AIDS: Her last CD4 was 56.  She was maintained on her\nHAART medications throughout the admission.\n\n4) SQUAMOUS/ADENOCARCINOMA OF LUNG: She has metastasis to her\nbrain and is status post stereotactic radiotherapy.  She had\nbeen recently treated with Tarceva.  She had tumor occluding her\nright mainstem bronchus causing collapse of her right lung that\nwas stented during her recent admission.  She was seen by her\noncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], on this admission who feels that no\nfurther treatment is warranted given the progression of her\ndisease.  Interventional Pulmonary also saw her and felt that\nthere was no indication for further intervention.\n\n5) CHRONIC PAIN: She was maintained on fentanyl and propofol\ndrip for pain control.\n\n6) ANEMIA: During her last admission, her baseline hematocrit\nwas between 24-27.  Iron studies last admission, appears to be\ncombination of iron deficiency and ACD.  She was not transfused\nsince she does not have active coronary disease.  Her hematocrit\nremained stable throughout the admission.\n.\n7) FEN: She was initially NPO.  Tube feeds were to be started;\nhowever, she was not tolerating po intake through her OG tube.\nHer electrolytes were repleted as needed.\n.\n8) ACCESS: A right femoral line was placed.\n\n9) PROPHYLAXIS: She was maintained on a PPI and subcutaneous\nheparin.\n\n10) Code: On hospital day 2, she was made DNR with no pressors,\nno shocks, and no antiarrhythmics. On hospital day 4, she was\nmade comfort measures only.  She was extubated and expired.\n\n.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nTrimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 80-400 mg PO DAILY\nFluconazole 200 mg PO Q24H\nAzithromycin 600 mg PO Q SUNDAY/WEDNESDAY\nMorphine 10 mg/5 mL PO Q4H\nAmoxicillin-Pot Clavulanate 500-125 mg PO Q8H x 13 days\nBenzonatate 100 mg PO TID\nLidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) Patch QD\nPropranolol 20 mg PO BID\nFentanyl 100 mcg/hr Patch 72HR\nFentanyl 75 mcg/hr Patch 72HR\nPantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H\nTenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 300 mg PO DAILY\nEmtricitabine 200 mg PO Q24H\nStavudine 30 mg PO Q12H\nAlbuterol Neb Q6H prn\nFurosemide 20 mg PO DAILY\nHydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5-500 mg PO Q4-6H prn\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\nNone.\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nExpired.\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired.\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nNone.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nNone.\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2192-8-2**]",
