In the ED he was found to be hypoxic to 80% on RA\n-> 100% NRB.  He was hypotensive despite 6L of fluids and\nlevophed was started.

The region of\nhypodensity corresponds to the region of increased T2 signal\nnoted at the time of prior MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute intracranial hemorrhage\nis identified. The lateral ventricles are symmetric in size and\nnondilated, and appear unchanged in size from the time of MR.\nThe basilar cisterns are patent. The density values of the brain\nparenchyma are otherwise within normal limits. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white\ndifferentiation is otherwise preserved, without evidence of\nacute minor or major vascular territorial infarct. Bone windows\nagain demonstrate a craniotomy within the left frontal bone with\nmetallic fixation devices. The mastoid air cells and paranasal\nsinuses are normally pneumatized.\n\nIMPRESSION: Hypodensity within the left posterior frontal lobe,\njust deep to the patient's craniotomy, consistent with\npost-operative changes following resection of left posterior\nfrontal metastatic focus. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or\nmass effect identified.\n\nECHO:\nConclusions:\n1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.\n2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal\ntechnical\nquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully\nexcluded. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).\n3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic\nregurgitation\nis seen.\n4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)\nmitral\nregurgitation is seen.\n5. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n\nAP PORTABLE CHEST @ 12 NOON: Comparison is made to prior study\nat 10 a.m. There has been interval placement of a right internal\njugular central venous catheter with its tip in the right\natrium. The patient is in gross pulmonary edema with increased\nopacification of the right base most likely representing pleural\nfluid. No pneumothorax.\nDR.

Positive study for pulmonary embolism in a right middle and\nright upper lobe artery [**Last Name (un) 94110**]. Part of the clot extends into\nthe right main pulmonary artery.\n2. Interval progression of pleural and pulmonary metastasis.\n3. Interval increase of bilateral pleural effusions (right\ngreater than\nleft). The right pleural effusion appears to be slightly\nloculated.\n4. Diffuse interstitial lung ground glass opacities sparing the\nright apex that could represent pulmonary edema, hemorrhage or\ndrug reaction.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n70M w/hx lung CA, mets renal CA (to brain and lungs) s/p recent\nresection ago p/w Klebesilla septic shock, PNA, UTI, ARF and\nworsening weakness and ataxia. The self extubated in the unit on\n[**10-28**] and transferred to the floor.\n\n# Septic shock/Urosepsis ??????He presented with fever, hypotension,\ntachycardia, tachypnea w/ elevated wbc and hypoxia requiring\nintubation and pressor support.  He was found to have\npansensitive klebsiella sepsis. He is s/p empiric azithro x 5\ndays (last [**10-24**]). He also received Levo for 3 days and stress\ndose steroids.\n\n# Hypoxia: [**12-24**] pulmonary edema, pleural effusion (too small to\ntap per IP on [**10-25**]), PE, Vent associated PNA . Self extuabted on\n[**10-28**] and has been managed in NC O2.\n He was started on bactrim PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. He contracted a vent\nassociated PNA so will continue with levo/zosyn/vanc.\n\n# PE: Found on CTA. Was placed on heparin which weas stopped\nonce the patient's HCT dropped on [**10-30**].\n\n# Brain mets/weakness RUE weakness, [**12-24**] brain met resection. Was\nplaced on steroids and will continue taper.\n\n# ARF: no hydronephrosis on US; was likely pre-renal, now\nresolved\n\n# Renal CA: He has widespread metastis and this is terminal. The\npatient was going to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] for further treatment\noptions but has decided against this.\n\n# Anemia/ GI bleed- likely [**12-24**] chronic dz, The patient had one\nepisode of coffee ground emesis in the setting of heparin gtt.\nHi HCT was stable after this until [**10-29**]  when he had a 11 point\nHCT drop. No BRBPR. He likely has a GI bleed or is bleeding into\nhis abdominal mass. He was transfused one unit before discharge.\n\n\n# Care plan: Following the patient's extuabtion he was adamant\nthat he wanted to go home. he will go home whit hospice. His PCP\nwas [**Name (NI) 653**] about this ans is in agreeement. the paitnet\nunderstands that he may not have long to live given possible GI\nbleed abd oregression of his CA. Heis family is very supportive\nabout this diecsion.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nthyroxine 15 mcg po q24h\ncartia XT 180mg po q24h\nallergra 60mg po prn\nadvair 250/50 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **]\nB12 500mg 4 tabs po q24h\noxycodone 15mg 1-4 tabs prn/24h\nranitidine 150mg po bid\nneurontin 400mg po bid-tid\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
