He was\ndiagnosed with lung cancer on [**2131-2-1**] after he presented\nwith cough and hemoptysis.  CT of the chest still showed a\nleft upper lobe mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Fine\nneedle biopsy of the left upper lobe mass on [**2131-2-16**] showed\npoorly differentiated non-small lung cancer.  He was at Stage\n3B.\n\nHe then underwent neoadjuvant and carboplatin and Taxol with\nconcurrent chest radiation.  A restaging FDG-PET scan on\n[**2131-6-19**] showed decreased uptake at the left lobe, but his\nPET scan also staying the same of taking the right temporal\nbrain.  MRI on [**2131-6-24**] showed three brain mets, which\ninclude one with greater  than 3 cm in diameter at the right\nposterior temporal lobe, one at the right insula, and the\nthird one at the right singlet gyrus region.  He was\nasymptomatic from the brain tumors.\n\nOn [**2131-6-30**], he experienced nausea, fatigue, slurring of\nspeech, confusion, and hiccups.  He came to our Emergency\nDepartment at [**Hospital1 69**] on\n[**2131-6-30**].  His symptoms promptly resolved after starting\nDecadron.  The posterior right temporal region was completely\nresected by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2131-7-3**].  The pathology was\nconsistent with non-small cell lung cancer.  He completed a\ncourse of Decadron uneventfully and is now scheduled for\nradiosurgery.\n\nToday, he appeared lethargic and apparently confused per\nfamily.  At 5 p.m., he went to the bathroom and exited with\nhis pants down and confused.  Family called 911.  By the time\nEMS arrived, he generalized, shaking left upper and lower\nextremities.

He was loaded with Dilantin and the seizure\nstopped shortly thereafter.  He is not in stable condition,\nalthough he is snoring with transmitted upper airway sounds.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer.\n\nHypertension.\n\nMEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife, who is the\nhealthcare proxy.  According to his daughter, he stated he\ndid not wish to be resuscitated.\n\nEXAM UPON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 157/66, pulse 115,\nrespiratory rate 32, and 99 percent on 100 percent FIO2.  He\nhas moderate upper airway obstruction, which improved with\noral airway.  Heart has regular, rate, and rhythm.  Lungs are\nclear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft and\nnontender.  Extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis, or\nedema.  On neurologic exam, his eyes are closed and he did\nnot open to stimulation.  There is no spontaneous movement.\nCranial nerves, his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to\nlight with sharp optic disc margins.  He has a dolls and corneal\nreflex.

His toes are\nupgoing bilaterally.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient will continue on Dilantin and then\nawoke to be transferred from the ICU to the floor.  He was\nalso given Decadron to decrease any possible swelling in his\nbrain.  He did have a MRI of the brain, which showed the ring-\nenhancing lesion in the right posterior temporal region with\nincreased surrounding edema since the MRI study on [**2131-7-30**].\nThe enhancing lesion in the right subinsular region, left\ncerebellar hemisphere appeared unchanged compared to prior\nstudy.  There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus seen on\nthe insula.\n\nWhen patient awoke, he had a little bit of neglect, which\nthen improved throughout the hospital course.  His neurologic\nexam was completely normal by the time he was discharged.  He\nis to continue on his Decadron and Dilantin until he is to\nsee Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in the [**Hospital 746**] Clinic.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status epilepticus.\n\nMetastatic brain cancer from non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.
