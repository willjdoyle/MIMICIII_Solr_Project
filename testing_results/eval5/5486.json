She had apparently been in USOH at\n6:20PM when she was taking care of her grandchild.  Sometime\nafter 7PM, her husband felt that she was having some difficulty\ntalking and that she was \"not making sense.\"  She was speaking\nslowly, with some slurred words, and though the words were\ncorrect in and of themselves, they were out of context and\ndidn't fit with each other.  She was also speaking in\nfragmentary sentences.  Initially, she seemed to\ncomprehend what was said to her.  Her husband helped her to bed,\nthough he noted that she had no obvious weakness or facial droop\nnoted, nor difficulty with gait.  He called their son at 7:50,\nwho arrived at 8:15PM and felt that she was not understanding\nwhat was said to her.  She repeated \"I'm feeling better, I'm\nfeeling better\" but otherwise did not say much.  Her daughter\nhad called EMS and she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] where sbp initially\nelev to 200.\n\nIn retrospect (on ROS) she seemed slightly unstable on feet\nprior night.  She has had no c/o headache, visual or hearing\nchanges, trouble speaking/swallowing prior to this event,\nweakness/numbness anywhere, and she has not fallen/hit head.\nShe has had a chronic cough (productive, no hemoptysis) over\nmonths. She has also c/o CP at night.  No wt loss/f/c/GI c/o\nexcept for constipation, and no urinary/MSK c/o.  She has had\nsome memory problems for several months (remembering names,\netc.)  She has c/o some insomnia, fatigue recently, and itching\nof the ears, but all other ROS neg.\n\nPast Medical History:\nHypertension\nHyperlipidemia\nGERD\ndepression\nosteoma left skull\nspindle cell neoplasm/leomysis cutis on knee\nskin cancer s/p biopsy several mo ago\n\nSocial History:\nLives with husband does not smoke or drink; former accountant,\nhas two children.\n\nFamily History:\nno cancers, strokes or seizures in the family\n\nPhysical Exam:\nT 96.3  BP initially 202/96 (down to 142/48 when seen), HR 80s,\nRR 18  98%RA->95%2L in ER\nGeneral appearance: well appearing initially\nHEENT: moist mucus membranes, clear oropharynx\nNeck: supple, no bruits\nHeart: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nLungs: poor insp effort, no apparent crackles/rhonchi/wheezes\nAbdomen: soft, nontender +bs\nExtremities: warm, well-perfused\nSkull & Spine: no TTP along spine\n\nMental Status: alert and interactive, but cannot answer\nquestions appropriately with Russian interpreter at bedside\n(asks interpreter \"how are you\" but this is only sentence heard,\noccasionally says 1 word).  Followed commands to open/close\neyes; opened her mouth when asked to stick out tongue. No other\ncommands.\n\nCranial Nerves: The visual fields had +blink to threat bilat,\nunable to assess fully; optic discs are normal in appearance.\nEOMI with no nystagmus, no apparent gaze preference/neglect;\n+brisk corneal bilat, pupils 2.5->2 briskly bilat, no facial\ndroop, smile symmetric, tongue/palate midline.  Hearing + to\nvoice.\n\nMotor System and sensory: Difficult to assess due to limited\ncommands - provides resistance on L arm better than R, and L leg\nslightly better than R - full strength at bilat IPs, foot\nplantarflexion, but everywhere else limited by ability to follow\ncommands.  W/d L side to stim better than R, but moves both\nsides well.  Remainder of sensory exam limited by comprehension.\n\nReflexes: The tendon reflexes are trace throughout, with upgoing\ntoe on R, down on L.\n\nCoordination: No obvious ataxia with mvmt, copied F-N with\nhand->nose instead, but did not appear tremulous or dysmetric.\n\nGait:  could not assess\n\nEXAM AFTER ACUTE DECOMPENSATION: (was alert initially, but at\n12:30AM rapidly decompensated - had apparent seizure <1min of\nappearing stiff, staring straight, foaming at the mouth, with\ndecreased responsiveness afterwards)\nNo response to verbal, +eye opening to sternal rub, moans; L\npupil 4mm/nonreactive, R pupil 2mm->1.5 sluggish, corneals\nintact bilat, +nasal tickle, +OCR, w/d L side vigorously to\nstim, but R side only slight w/d to stim.\n\nPertinent Results:\nAdmission labs:\nWBC 11.3 D  H/H 13.4/39.3  PLT 255\nN:62.5 L:31.4 M:4.4 E:1.0 Bas:0.7\n\nPT: 11.5  PTT: 21.0  INR: 1.0\n\nUA neg x 30 protein\n\nHCT: Multiple foci consistent with acute intraparenchymal\nhemorrhage within the left temporal and parietal lobes as\ndescribed above, with probable hemorrhage also within the\ntemporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle without subfalince\nherniation. Primary diagnostic consideration is amyloid\nangiopathy.\n\nRepeat HCT: Marked interval enlargement of the left temporal\nparenchymal hemorrhage, with marked increase in mass effect\nproducing compression of the left lateral ventricle and\ndilatation of the right lateral ventricle, probable subfalcine\nand possible uncal herniation.\nNOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW:\nThere is definite evidence of subfalcine and uncal herniation,\nas there is medial displacement of the uncus of the right\ntemporal lobe, as well as effacement of the right\nperimesencephalic cistern and slight rotation of the midbrain\nand distortion of the ipsilateral ambient cistern. There is no\nevidence of ipsilateral PCA territorial infarction.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n74 y/o Russian speaking female with hx hypertension,\nhyperlipidemia, GERD, depression, osteoma left skull and\n?spindle cell neoplasm/leomysis cutis on knee, and\napparent hx skin cancer s/p bx few mo ago presents with\ndifficulty speaking and understanding, initially found on exam\nto have mixed aphasia with both sensory and motor components, no\nrepetition, subtle R sided weakness, head CT with multiple foci\nof hemorrhage (lobar). Several hours later, she acutely\ndecompensated with seizure, L blown pupil, uncal herniation on\nCT with large expansion of L temporal lobe bleed. She was given\nPHT 1.2 g and Mannitol 50 g and intubated. Etiology of\nhemorrhage is unclear, with concern for metastases given\nmultiple foci of hemorrhage, though still possible that the\nbleed was from an underlying vascular anomaly, HTN or amyloid;\nthe family denied trauma.\n\nNeurosurgery had been called and, after a discussion with the\nfamily, it was determined that the patient would not have wanted\nsurgical intervention at this stage in her course. Despite being\nstarted on mannitol and hyperventilated, the patient continued\nto worsen. She slowly lost all brainstem reflexes. She was taken\noff the propofol but remained unresponsive. After 24hours off\nall sedation, she had a formal brain death exam, which was\nnotable for absence of all brain stem reflexes, including apnea\nresponse. She was declared brain dead on [**10-18**] and all\nsupportive measures were withdrawn. The family was at the\nbedside.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications prior to admission on OMR:\nASTELIN 137MCG--Two sprays twice a day\nATENOLOL 25MG--One by mouth every day\nATORVASTATIN CALCIUM 10 mg--One (1) tablet po once a day.\nCLONAZEPAM 0.5MG--One tablet at night as needed for anxiety\nOMEPRAZOLE 20MG--Twice a day\nRHINOCORT 32MCG--2 squirts in each nostril twice a day for\nallergies\n\n(Family only able to confirm: Atenolol, \"stomach med,\" Vitamin E\nand MVI - all others per OMR)\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\nNot applicable\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nLeft temporal hemorrhage\nUncal herniation\nBrain death\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nNot applicable\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nNot applicable\n\n                             [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 162**] MD [**MD Number(2) 2575**]\n\n",
