She was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for altered mental\nstatus and increasing unresponsiveness within the past week. At\nthat time she was found to be hypokalemic to K of 2.6 and\ndehydrated. After IV fluid rescucitation and potassium repletion\nshe was discharged home.\n.\nOn the day of admission, she came to clinic for a scheduled XRT\ntreatment. She was found to be hypokalemic with severely\ndepressed mental status. At that visit she opened her eyes to\nher name but was not speaking or following commands. She did\nrespond to painful stimulus. On arrival to the oncology floor,\nthe patient had vitals of 96.0 92 108/64 22 97% RA. She was\nnoted to be minimally responsive. Out of concern for mass effect\nand/or seizure activity, the patient received 10mg dexamethasone\nand 1mg IV ativan. Subsequently her blood pressure declined to\nsbp 80 and then 60. She received a 1L NS bolus with return of\nsbp to 107. The patient also became bradypneic with this\nepisode. She was transferred to the ICU for further care.\n.\nAfter transfer, the patient's primary oncologist had a\ndiscussion with the patient and her family. The decision was\nmade for no further invasive tests or imaging studies. The\npatient will receive IV fluids, antibiotics and other IV\nmedications as well as have lab draws.\n.\nROS: Unable to obtain.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Metastatic breast cancer. Initially presented in [**2119-11-14**]\nwith a lytic lesion in the left leg and a breast mass. Biopsy\nrevealed infiltrating carcinoma. HER-2/neu negative, ER\npositive. S/p cyberknife radiation therapy to an 8mm left\ncerebellar lesion. Known bony mets. Likely leptomeningeal spread\non MR brain [**2120-4-30**]. Received palliative XRT to the thoracic\nspine. She is on cycle 2 of Taxol and Avastin.\n- Multiple episodes of severe malignancy associated\nhypercalcemia and altered mental status.\n- S/p surgical repair of left tibia on [**2120-1-2**]\n- Prior hysterectomy and bilateral salpngo-oophorectomy in [**2115**]\nfor benign causes.\n- Surgery for ectopic pregnancy in [**2090**].\n\n\nSocial History:\nMarried. Previous associate principal in a middle school. 2\ndaughters in their 40's. Lifetime nonsmoker with rare alcohol\nuse.\n\nFamily History:\nHalf-sister with breast CA at age 63. No other known cancers in\nthe family.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nPE 79 102/38 6 99% RA\nGen: Unresponsive. Moans once. Not following any commands. Not\nresponding to painful stimulus.\nHEENT: PERRL. Eyes pointing upwards.\nCV: RRR. Normal S1 and S2. No M/R/G.\nPulm: CTA bilaterally.\nAbd: Soft, nontender. No distention or organomegaly.\nExt: Trace left lower extremity edema. No right lower extremity\nedema.\nNeuro: Unresponsive to commands or painful stimulus. PERRL.\nFlexed right upper extremity slowly improved with movement.\nUnable to ilicit reflexes at the patella. Upgoing toes\nbilaterally.\n.\n\nPertinent Results:\nLabs: Na 143, K 2.9, Cl 110, Bicarb 22, BUN/Cr 5/0.5, Ca 9.0, Mg\n1.7, Phos 2.1, WBC 4.3 (76% N, 14% L), Hct 32.0, platelets 259.\n.\nALT 14, AST 43, AP 339, LDH 539, T Bili 0.6, Alb 3.1.\n.\nCEA 97, CA 27.29 pending.\n.\nEKG: None available.\n.\nMicro:\nBlood culture\n([**2120-6-24**]): No growth.\n([**2120-7-8**]): Pending.\nUrine culture\n([**2120-6-24**]): No growth.\n.\nImaging:\nMR brain with and without contrast ([**2120-4-30**]): 1. New metastatic\ninvolvement of the leptomeninges, most notable of the posterior\nfossa. 2. Stable minimal residual enhancement at the site of\ntreatment of the left cerebellar metastasis. No new brain\nparenchymal lesions. 3. Interval slight worsening in calvarial\nmetastases including infiltration of the skull base and upper\ncervical vertebra.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr [**Known lastname 77692**] is a 59 yo woman with history of metastatic breast\ncancer presenting with two weeks duration of confusion and\nicreasing lethargy.\n\nMs. [**Known lastname 77692**] was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for subacute, progressive\nunresponsiveness and a hypotensive episode likely due to volume\ndepletion.  Her unresponsiveness was likely secondary to\nprogression of her widely metastatic breast cancer, including\npossible leptomeningeael spread.  Also, considered was seizure\nactivity with post-ictal state and toxic-metabolic mediated\naltered status in the setting of hypercalcemia and hypocalemia.\nOn admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], initially, the goals of care were\ndiscussed, and it was decided not to pursue further chest\nx-rays, MRI brain, EEG or lumbar puncture.  She was volume\nresuscitated, and her electrolytes were repleted.  The next\nmorning, [**2120-7-9**], both palliative care and social work met with\nthe family to continue to discuss goals of care, which included\nbeing able to take her home with comfort (but not CMO).  Per her\nneuro-oncologist, however, CT head and MRI of head and neck as\nwell as EEG were ordered with agreement from family.  She was\ngiven a Keppra load and will start on maintenance doses on the\noncology floor.  She was deemed stable for transfer to the\noncology floor on [**2120-7-9**].\n\nOn the floor the patient remained stable hemodynamically and\nneurolgically. The patient received phenytoin and was continued\non levitiracetam on Neuro/onc recomendation. The MRI showed no\nevidence of leptomeningeal disase with stable CNS disease.\nContinous EEG was obtained which showed evidence of\nencephalopathy.\n\nThe patient was noted electrolyte abnomalities suggestive of non\nanion gap metabolic acidosis which improved on IVF.\n\nThe patient's discomfort was managed with IV morhine which was\ntransitioned to concerntrated elixir at discharge. After a\ndiscusion with the family regarding the goals of care a decision\nwas made to transition care at home with comfort care.\nPalliative care was involved in the management of this patient\nand family discussions.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMeds, Inpatient:\n- Heparin 5000U subq\n- Pantoprazole 40mg Daily\n.\nMeds, Outpatient:\n- Oxycodone prn\n- Compazine\n- Zofran\n- Oxycontin\n- Colace prn\n- Prilosec prn\n- Ativan prn\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
