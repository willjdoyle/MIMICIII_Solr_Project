He said this was initially a constant sensation,\nand\nthen ressolved. He also noticed lightheadedness when getting out\nof his car or going from sitting to standing. He had a similar\nbout of dizziness 1.5 years prior. He later noticed that when he\nwould look up or down (but not turn his head in a specific\ndirection), he would get vertigo lasting 15-20 seconds. He also\nnoticed a buzzing sound in his head, but this was not unilateral\nin his ears. He denied weakness, numbness, diplopia, dysarthria,\nor dysphagia.\n\nHe was evaluated by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2113-9-15**] and was found to be\northostatic on exam at that time (laying 147/75, standing\n113/68). He returned to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2113-11-15**] for tinnitus and\nvertigo when moving his head \"from front to back\". He had\nstopped\nhis Flomax because of these symptoms, and his Effexor continued\nto be tapered. The patient was referred to ENT. Auditory testing\nwas normal, but ENG showed BPPV with a positive [**Last Name (un) **] Hallpike to\nthe right. He reports that he did not do the Epley maneuver at\nhome.\n\nThen last Wednesday (5 days prior), he was talking on the phone\nto his son when driving to work and had the sudden onset of \"not\ngetting my thoughts togther\" and \"couldn't get my words out.\" He\ndenied any paraphasias, but reported that he felt \"in a fog\".\nHis\nson noticed that he wasn't speaking normally. This lasted for 1\nhour. When thinking further, he remembers that within the past 2\nmonths he had another similar episode at work when talking to\nthe\nU.K. He wanted to say something and couldn't get the words out\nor\nget his thoughts together. This lasted approximately 1 hour and\nthen ressolved.\n\nOn ROS, in addition to above, he denies any shaking of his arms\nor legs, urinary or stool incontinence, or foul tastes/smells.\nHe\ndenies any headaches. He denies any weight loss or night sweats,\nbut has been fatigued recently. He reports a normal colonoscopy\nin the past 4-5 months.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nCAD s/p Cypher stent to OM1 [**1-14**]\nHypertension-per his PCP's records, but the patient denies this\ndiagnosis\nHyperlipidemia\nBPH\nBPPV\nAllergic rhinitis\nBilateral renal cysts, largest 5.4 x 5.3 cm in the right kidney\nAnxiety\n\n\nSocial History:\nThe patient works as an accountant and lives at\nhome with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] denies cigarette use ever, drinks\n\"seldom\"\nEtOH but does not quantify it more than that, and denies illicit\ndrug use including cocaine and heroin.\n\n\nFamily History:\nFather with MI at age 63.

Initially has some\nword finding difficulties but think this is due to his anxiety\nand stress about the possible diagnoses (when asked when his\ncolonoscopy was he says \"[**3-12**]...\" and then becomes scared that he\ncannot remember the time period, but is able to say \"what is\nhappening to me, why can't I get my words out?\") Oriented to\nperson, place, and date.

Imaging revealed a left parietal bleed and\nsuggested an underlying mass, likely high-grade glioma.  CT\ntorso did not reveal other neoplasms.  EEG was normal but the\npatient was started on keppra for seizure prophylaxis given his\nrisk for seizures with the bleed and mass.  Neuro-oncology and\nneurosurgery were consulted, and recommended resection of the\nlesion.\n\nPrior to resection, LP was done by neuro-oncology.  Functional\nMRI was done for [**Numeric Identifier **]-operative planning given concern that the\nlesion could be near the language area, but suggested it was\ninfact more near the region of the right foot and possibly the\ntongue.\n\nOn [**2114-1-12**], the patient was to neurosurgery and undwerwent a left\nparietal craniotomy for tumor. He was transfered to the ICU\npost-operatively and then back to neurology floor. He was\nclosely followed by brain tumor team (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 3929**] from radiation oncology) and their recs were followed.\nthe prelim bipsoy results showed malignant glioma but the final\nresult was still pending.\n\nAspirin and Plavix were held on admission due to the\nintraparenchymal bleeding and in preparation for neurosurgery.\nGiven his cardiac stent, post-operatively these medications were\nstarted as per discussion with neurosurgery team.  He was on\nsteroids during hospital stay which were continued in dose of\ndexamethasone 1 mg TID even after discharge.\n\nHe was started on keppra 750 [**Hospital1 **] which was increased to 1000 mg\n[**Hospital1 **] at discharge for prophylaxis for seizures.\n\nHe was seen and evaluated by PT/OT/Speech therapy and frequently\nfollowed upon. It was decided to discharge home with home\nPT/Speech/ and OT therapy.\n\nHis physical exam during hopsital course was assesed frequently\nand it did show gradual but definitive improvement. At DC, the\nneuro exam was notable for conduction aphasia but no other motor\nsensory deficits.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAtenolol 25 mg daily\nASA 325 mg daily\nPlavix 75 mg daily\nFluticasone 50 mcg, 2 sprays NU daily\nNitroglycerin 0.3 mg prn chest pain\nSimvastatin 20 mg daily\nMVI daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
